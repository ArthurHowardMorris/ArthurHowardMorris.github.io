I teach Managerial Accounting at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://www.ust.hk/home)). I research the relationships that form within and across the boundaries of the firm, how stakeholders use contracts to formalize these relationships, and how those contracts shape behavior.

Before taking my current position in Hong Kong, I taught at NYU - Shanghai where I was an Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow.
