## SPREADSHEET ERRORS

Here’s a curated list of notable cost allocation errors from real-world financial cases, suitable for advanced managerial accounting discussions:

## **High-Profile Cost Allocation Errors**

1. **J.P. Morgan’s "White Whale" Debacle (2012)**

3. **Lazard’s SolarCity Valuation Mistake**  
   - **Error**: Computational spreadsheet error discounted SolarCity’s value by **$400 million** during Tesla’s acquisition [^1].  

4. **Tibco Software Shareholder Loss**

   - **Impact**: Shareholders received **$100 million less** than expected [^1].  

5. **Uber’s Driver Commission Arithmetic Error**

6. **Bank of America’s $4 Billion Loss**

## **Key Themes in Allocation Errors**  

- **Spreadsheet risks**: Copy-paste errors, formula flaws, and manual entry mistakes dominate high-profile cases [^1] [^2].  
- **Methodological inconsistencies**: Inadequate recognition of reciprocal relationships (e.g., service departments) or flawed allocation bases [^3].  
- **Regulatory and reputational risks**: Errors often lead to fines, investor distrust, and operational inefficiencies [^4].  

For deeper analysis, explore **reciprocal vs. step/direct methods** in cost allocation [^3], and compare spreadsheet-driven errors [^1] [^2] with methodological inconsistencies [^4].
