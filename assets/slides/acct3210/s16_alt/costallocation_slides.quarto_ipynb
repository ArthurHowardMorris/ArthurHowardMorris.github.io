Why the discrepancy? Refer back to L Table 8-1. In this example, the Cars division uses roughly equal fractions of the two service departments (57 percent and 58 percent), and the Trucks division uses roughly equal fractions of the service departments (43 percent and 42 percent). Because these fractions are roughly the same in both departments, the total costs allocated to the divisions vary little across the various methods. However, the transfer prices per phone and gigabyte vary dramatically. In general, the allocation methods can yield substantial differences in amounts allocated. The numbers chosen for this example illustrate that transfer prices can vary greatly even when the cost allocation methods have little effect on the total amounts allocated. -->\n",

        "\n",
        "- The sequence used is arbitrary and large differences can result in the cost per unit of service using different sequences. \n",
        "- Also, the step-down method ignores the fact that although departments earlier in the sequence use service departments later in the sequence, earlier departments are not allocated these costs.\n",
