# Insulating and non-insulating allocations

### Insulating and non-insulating allocations

- __Common costs:__ arise when it is less expensive to provide an internal product or service centrally.

- __Consider:__ the two divisions of the hard drive manufacturer (SSD and HHD) share:

1. building maintenance
2. grounds
3. property taxes security
4. human resources department

### Questions:

1. Should the common costs be allocated to the manufacturing divisions?
2. If so, how?
Both profit center managers' compensation is based on accounting profit 1) of their profit center, after deducting any allocated common cost. Hence, cost allocations affect the managers' welfare, and their behavior. If common costs are not allocated, the managers in the two divisions have less incentive to invest in the specialized knowledge necessary to determine the optimum level of the common costs. If the decision rights over the level of common costs do not reside with the managers of the two divisions and the common costs are not allocated back to the two divisions, the division managers will demand more common resources. If these managers individually or collectively have the decision rights over the common resources but are not charged for the common costs, these costs will grow rapidly as the managers invent ways to substitute off-budget common costs for currently consumed inputs included in their budget. For example, security guards are a common cost. Suppose security costs are not charged to either division. The division managers have an incentive to use security guards to perform maintenance or even operate machines, thereby reducing the amount of direct labor charged to each division's budget.
Most firms allocate common costs, presumably to prevent individual divisions from overconsuming the common resource. The next question becomes choosing an allocation base. Choosing an allocation base causes base to be taxed and, as demonstrated earlier, managers will reduce their consumption of the taxed item. But this creates other incentives. Consider the following illustration.

### __A. Noninsulating method__

A noninsulating method uses a driver that varies with the manager's performance measures (e.g. div. operating income)

|                 | Jan. HDD | Jan. SSD | Jan. HHD | Jan. SSD |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Div. Op. Income | \$8,000   | \$8,000   | \$8,000   | \$2,000   |
| Allocated costs | (500)    | (500)    | (800)    | (200)    |
| Net income      | \$7.500   | \$7.500   | \$7,200   | \$1,800   |

This is a tax on operating income. 

### __B. Insulating method__ 

An insulating allocation uses a driver that does not vary with the manager's performance measures (e.g. floorspace).

|                 | Jan. HDD | Jan. SSD | Jan. HHD | Jan. SSD |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Div. Op. Income | \$8,000   | \$8,000   | \$8,000   | \$2,000   |
| Allocated costs | (600)    | (400)    | (600)    | (400)    |
| Net income      | \$7.400   | \$7,600   | \$7,400   | \$1,600   |

# Allocations in practice

The previous chapter introduced the topic of cost allocations. Cost allocations are pervasive- most organizations, including profit,
nonbront. service. and manutacturing mrms. allocate costs. cost allocations serve numerous ends such as taxes. inventor nonprofit, service, and manufacturing firms, allocate costs. Cost allocations serve numerous ends such as taxes, inventory valuation, cost-based reimbursements, and decision management and control.
In terms of creating incentives, cost allocations are like internal tax systems that cause decision makers to use less of the allocation base.
Thus, the allocation bases chosen (what to tax) affect the consumption of resources inside the firm. Cost allocations also create incentives to cooperate. Finally, noninsulating allocation methods help diversify the risk that managers bear. However, cost allocations can distort the reported performance of managers, divisions, products, and services being allocated the costs.

# Death spiral

The death spiral results when utilization of a common resource (with significant fixed costs) falls, creating excess capacity. Average (full)
cost transter pricing charges the users for the common resource. The tixed costs are borne hv the remaining lisers who have incentive to cost transfer pricing charges the users for the common resource. The fixed costs are borne by the remaining users who have incentive to reduce utilization, further raising the average cost and causing additional defections.
Notice that the death spiral can occur whenever full-cost transfer pricing is used, there are significant fixed costs, and the user has some discretion over the quantity of the common resource to use. As discussed in L Chapter 5, one of the problems with full-cost
Page 321
transfer pricing is underutilization of the common resource. Too few units are transferred.

Managerial Application: Death Spiral in Corporate Jets
The annual operating cost of a corporate jet ranges between \$40 and \$50 million. Corporate flight departments routinely charge part or all of these costs to those internal departments using the aircraft. Allocating operating costs to internal users allows flight departments to justify the expense of the aircraft to top management, to apportion operating costs according to usage patterns, and to prevent overscheduling. Initially, only the direct operating costs (fuel and landing fees) were charged back to departments using the aircraft, while fixed costs were not (pilot salaries, maintenance costs, hangar rental, and insurance). When firms faced downturns in their business, a popular expense reduction target was to cut corporate jet usage by allocating the fixed costs along with the direct costs of operating the aircraft. Since fixed costs accounted for about 50 percent of the total cost at full utilization, usage rapidly shrank to the point where fixed costs rose to 85 percent of the total allocated cost. Jet usage dropped further, and each flight hour allocated became even more costly, sometimes approaching the cost of chartering a jumbo jet. This example illustrates how the
"death spiral" arises when substantial fixed costs exist and utilization falls. Fortunately, the term death spiral applies figuratively, and not literally, to corporate jets.

## solution

There are several solutions to the death spiral. When excess capacity exists, users should be charged for only the variable cost of the resource. Alternatively, some of the fixed costs could be excluded from the transfer price. For example, the \$600,000 in fixed costs (accounting depreciation of existing equipment) should be excluded because with excess capacity the opportunity cost of this equipment is zero.

Using practical capacity instead of actual utilization in calculating the overhead rate offers another way to resolve the death spiral. Practical capacity represents the amount of capacity the common resource (e.g., the telephone system) was expected to provide when it was purchased and used under normal operating circumstances. If the phone system was purchased to provide 2.500 phone lines, then 2.500 is the practical capacity.

A caution: if you are not careful, you might use arithmetic to convince yourself that adding new products or services may __decrease fixed costs__. No production decision, other than actually changing the fixed costs themselves, can change fixed costs.

# Allocating capacity cost: depreciation

As seen in the previous section, a death spiral results when a common resource with significant fixed costs and excess capacity is allocated to users who have discretion over utilization of the resource. In the telecommunications example, depreciation of the existing phone system is the principal fixed cost. Not allocating some (or all) of the fixed cost offers one way to reduce the death spiral. For example, allocate only the fixed cost of the capacity actually being used. If 40 percent excess capacity exists, allocate only 60 percent of the depreciation. However, this solution to the death spiral creates other concerns.
Notice that the death spiral, or underutilization of the common resource, is really a problem of how to use an existing resource. How much of the existing common resource should each user use? If excess capacity exists, any charge discourages its use. However, prior to deciding how to allocate the available capacity among existing users, the firm had to decide how much capacity to acquire. In the previous example, the firm had to decide how large a phone system to buy (how much phone-mail capacity, how many lines, how fast a switch, and so forth).
The current fixed costs of the phone system (including depreciation) were "variable" costs prior to acquiring the capacity. Accounting depreciation (such as straight line) represents the annual historical cost of acquired capacity. Depreciation is the allocation of the asset's historical cost over time.
How much capacity should the firm acquire? The future users of that capacity usually have private knowledge of how intensively they will use the common resource. If these users know they will not be charged for their future use because fixed costs are not allocated when excess capacity exists, they will overstate their future use. Therefore, charging accounting depreciation is a commitment device.? Future users, knowing they will be charged for the historical cost of a durable asset, have less incentive to overstate their expected future utilization.
Allocating accounting depreciation to users commits them to recovering at least the historical cost of the asset.
In deciding whether to allocate depreciation on the common resource to its users, the firm makes a trade-off between the efficient investment in the common resource and its efficient utilization after acquisition. Charging depreciation helps control the overinvestment problem, but at the expense of underutilizing the asset after acquisition. Most firms charge users for depreciation. Thus, control of the overinvestment problem tends to dominate decision-making errors involving asset utilization (the death spiral). This is another example of how accounting systems tend to favor control when confronted with a choice between control and decision making.

# Allocating service department costs

We now examine a more realistic situation in which a number of service departments exist whose costs are allocated to several operating divisions. L Figure 8-1 illustrates the general case of N service
Page 326
departments and M operating divisions. In a manufacturing plant, the service departments consist of purchasing, human resources, security, maintenance, information technology, engineering, and so forth. The operating divisions might be separate product lines or manufacturing functions such as parts manufacturing and assembly lines. In order to compute the manufacturing cost of the final products for inventory valuation, the cost of the service departments must be allocated to the operating divisions. The service departments are like buckets of water that must be emptied into the operating divisions. The arrows indicate the direction of the service flows.

### Gettintg this right matters!

Managerial Application: Cost Allocations at IBM
During the 1980s and early 1990s, IBM had the policy of allocating costs from one line of business to another. Managers in those lines of business constantly argued that some of their overhead should be carried by other IBM businesses. IBM also typically allocated all of the R&D of a new technology to the line of business first using the technology, and subsequent users were able to utilize it for free. The cost allocation system masked the true profitability of many IBM businesses for years. IBM claimed it was making money in its PC business. But in 1992, "as IBM began to move away from its funny allocation system, IBM disclosed that its PC business was unprofitable." In 2004, IBM sold its PC division to China-based Lenovo Group for \$1.75 billion.

## Example:

__Capacity of service departments used:__

|--------------------|--------------------|-----|------|--------|-------|
| Telecommunications | 10%                | 20% | 40%  | 30%    | 100%  |
| IT                 | 25%                | 15% | 35%  | 25%    | 100%  |

__Service department costs:__

|--------------------|-----------|
| Telecommunications | 2,000,000 |
| IT                 | 6,000,000 |

### Good news, Bad news

- __Good news:__ everythin is allocated
- __Bad news:__ this is not a gooc estimated of opportunity cost per unit of service



While we do not know the correct opportunity cost, we do know that the direct allocation method excludes the service departments' use of other service departments and therefore incorrectly states the opportunity cost of each service department.

### Managerial Application: Hospitals Use Step-Down Allocations

The U.S. Medicare system requires each hospital to file a Medicare Cost Report to get reimbursed for providing health care Page 331 to Medicare patients. To file this report, all cost centers in the hospital (administration, finance, human resources) that supply services to other cost centers and major functional services, such as the emergency department, surgery, and maternity, are ordered in a step-down sequence. Each cost center allocates its cost using an allocation base. For example, nursing administration costs might be allocated using nursing hours or nursing salaries in each functional service. The Medicare Cost Report defines the order of the cost centers to be used in the step-down method but allows each hospital some discretion. For example, administration and general costs are usually allocated last. However, some hospitals move it up in the list. The step-down method allocates the cost of each service center, as well as the costs stepped down to it, to the major functional services. Many hospitals use the data generated by the Medicare Cost Report to set prices and to negotiate third-party contracts.

### Transfer pricing
The costs allocated to Cars and Trucks differ by only \$27,000 depending on whether telecommunications ( Table 8-4) or IT ( Table 8-5) is chosen first. In L Table 8-4, the Cars division is allocated \$4.648 million, and in L Table 8-5 the allocation is \$4.621 million. The difference of \$27,000 is less than 1 percent of the total costs allocated. Therefore, it would appear inconsequential as to whether telecommunications or IT is chosen over the direct allocation method. However, very different incentives result depending on which method is used. Allocated costs represent transfer prices. As we saw in L Chapter 5, transfer pricing affects the quantity of the internal service demanded. If too high a transfer price is set, a death spiral can result when substantial fixed costs exist in the service department.
To illustrate the effect of the cost allocation method on transfer prices, we expand the telecommunications and IT example. Suppose the allocation base in telecommunications is the number of telephones in each department, and in IT the allocation base is the number of gigabytes of disk space used. Transfer prices are to be established for telephones and gigabytes. Allocated costs will be used to compute the transfer prices. The number of phones and gigabytes are as follows:

|          | Allocation base      |
| Telecomm | 3,000 Telephones     |
| IT       | 12 million gigabytes |

<!-- if there was more appitite for data analysis we sould spend a lot more time on teh critical question of how best to actually choose allocation bases. -->

### Cost allocated per Giga of storage (Millions except cost per Gb)

Because the cost per phone (which represents the transfer price) varies depending on the choice of allocation method, the cost allocation scheme affects the decision of each department to add or drop phones. The sequence of service departments in the step-down method affects decision making because the last service department in the sequence reports a larger cost per unit of service. Remember that cost allocations are effectively internal tax schemes. How the taxes are applied affect the "price" decision makers face in deciding to add or drop phones.
The same conclusions hold for the information technology department. I Table 8-7 presents the equivalent computations for the Page 333
IT department, including the cost per gigabyte of storage across the various allocation methods. Again, note the wide variation in cost per gigabyte. The cost varies from $0.588 per gigabyte under the step-down method with IT chosen first to $0.895 under the step-down method with telecommunications chosen first. Also, note that the total charged to Cars (the last line) agrees with the previous calculations in L Tables 8-3, L2 8-4, and L 8-5.
We saw earlier that the various methods of allocating service department costs result in a difference of less than 1 percent of the total costs.
However, these same methods cause the cost-based transfer prices to vary by more than 140 percent for telephones (I $1,793 ÷ $741] ÷ $741) and more than 50 percent for gigabytes ([$0.895 ÷ $0.5881 ÷ $0.588). Why the discrepancy? Refer back to L Table 8-1. In this example, the Cars division uses roughly equal fractions of the two service departments (57 percent and 58 percent), and the Trucks division uses roughly equal fractions of the service departments (43 percent and 42 percent). Because these fractions are roughly the same in both departments, the total costs allocated to the divisions vary little across the various methods. However, the transfer prices per phone and gigabyte vary dramatically. In general, the allocation methods can yield substantial differences in amounts allocated. The numbers chosen for this example illustrate that transfer prices can vary greatly even when the cost allocation methods have little effect on the total amounts allocated.










One criticism of the step-down method is that the sequence used is arbitrary and large differences can result in the cost per unit of service using different sequences. Also, the step-down method ignores the fact that although departments earlier in the sequence use service departments later in the sequence, earlier departments are not allocated these costs.
The death spiral, described in I section A, can be a significant problem with step-down allocations if the service departments contain
signiticant amounts ot tixed costs. It transter prices are established for these service denartment costs. then users have incentives to use less significant amounts of fixed costs. If transfer prices are established for these service department costs, then users have incentives to use less of the high-cost service departments. (The high-cost departments are those last in the step-down chain.) As usage falls, total costs do not fall proportionately because of the fixed costs. This causes the costs allocated to the remaining users to rise further, and these users will seek to replace the inside service with outside vendors that offer lower costs.
