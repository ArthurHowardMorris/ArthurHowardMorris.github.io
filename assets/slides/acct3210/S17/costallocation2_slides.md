# Insulating and non-insulating allocations

### Allocating common costs

- __Common costs:__ arise when it is less expensive to provide an internal
  product or service centrally.
- __Consider:__ the two divisions of the hard drive manufacturer (SSD and HHD)
  share:

1. building maintenance
2. grounds
3. property taxes security
4. human resources department

### Questions:

1. Should the common costs be allocated to the manufacturing divisions?
2. If so, how?

### Considerations:

1. division managers get paid for their division's accounting profit
2. cost allocations act like taxes and affect the managers' welfare, and their
   behavior. 
3. if allocated, managers will seek to reduce costs by improving processes,
   cutting corners, or claiming not to need or use the common resource
4. if not allocated, managers will seek to maximize use of the common resources

### How should we interpret the _status quo_?

_"Most firms allocate common costs, presumably to prevent individual divisions
from overconsuming the common resource."_ (Zimmerman Textbook)

- and yet, forcing firms to adopt cost accounting systems improves their
  performance, suggesting that _some_ firms may just be using allocations from
  financial or tax accounting. ([Samuels, 2021](https://publications.aaahq.org/accounting-review/article/96/1/401/4242/Government-Procurement-and-Changes-in-Firm))

### To allocate we need an _allocation base/cost driver_:

An allocation base or cost driver is the metric used to allocate costs (like the aspirin in the hospital example).

- Choosing an allocation base is one of the most important topics in all of
  accounting. Choosing correctly requires analysis of processes, data, and incentives.
- This focus on this critical aspect of accounting is missing from most texts
  and this course.
- In this lecture we will consider the consequences of these choices.

## Insulating and non-insulating allocations

- the choice of driver can either insulate the manager's pay from the cost or not.

### __A. Non-insulating method__

A noninsulating method uses a driver that varies with the manager's performance
measures (e.g. div. operating income)

|                 | Jan. HDD | Jan. SSD | Feb. HHD | Feb. SSD |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Div. Op. Income | \$8,000  | \$8,000  | \$9,000  | \$2,000  |
| Allocated costs | (800)    | (800)    | (900)    | (200)    |
| Net income      | \$7,200  | \$7,200  | \$8,100  | \$1,800  |

This is a tax on operating income.

### __B. Insulating method__ 

An insulating allocation uses a driver that does not vary with the manager's
performance measures (e.g. floorspace).

|                 | Jan. HDD | Jan. SSD | Feb. HHD | Feb. SSD |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Div. Op. Income | \$8,000  | \$8,000  | \$9,000  | \$2,000  |
| Allocated costs | (600)    | (400)    | (600)    | (400)    |
| Net income      | \$7,400  | \$7,600  | \$8,400  | \$1,600  |

This is a tax on floorspace.

### Allocations in practice

- the allocation bases chosen (what to tax) affect the use of
  resources inside the firm. 
- cost allocations also create incentives to cooperate.
- cost allocations can distort reported performance

## Death spiral
- can occur when common costs consist primarily of fixed costs and users have
  discretion over their use of the common product or service.

### Steps in the death spiral:

1. The death spiral occurs when cost allocation reduces utilization of a
   common resource (with significant fixed costs).
   - i.e. the common cost is taxed, so it's utilization falls.
2. This creates excess capacity. Now the fixed cost is spread over fewer units of the allocation base.
3. This increases the allocation rate for the remaining users (increasing
   the 'tax' rate), which further reduces utilization.


### Death Spiral (not literal) in Corporate Jets

- The annual operating cost of a corporate jet ranges between \$40 and \$50
  million. 
- Corporate flight departments routinely charge part or all of these costs to
  those internal departments using the aircraft. 
- Allocating operating costs to internal users allows flight departments to
  justify the expense of the aircraft to top management, to apportion operating
  costs according to usage patterns, and to prevent overscheduling. 

### Death Spiral (not literal) in Corporate Jets

- Initially, only the direct operating costs (fuel and landing fees) were
  charged back to departments using the aircraft, while fixed costs were not
  (pilot salaries, maintenance costs, hangar rental, and insurance).

These costs are all variable, so no (figurative) danger

### Death Spiral (not literal) in Corporate Jets

- When firms faced downturns in their business, a popular expense reduction
  target was to cut corporate jet usage by allocating the fixed costs along
  with the direct costs of operating the aircraft. 

This makes sense, but now we are allocating fixed costs, and managers can
choose how much to use! __But their choice does not change the fixed costs.__ 


### Death Spiral (not literal) in Corporate Jets

- Since fixed costs accounted for about 50 percent of the total cost at __full
  utilization__, usage rapidly shrank to the point where fixed costs rose to 85
  percent of the total allocated cost. 

What happens when taxes go up?

### Death Spiral (not literal) in Corporate Jets


- Jet usage dropped further, and each flight hour allocated became even more
  costly, sometimes approaching the cost of chartering a jet. 
- At this point there is no economy of scale and no reason to produce the
  service internally!

### Can we avoid this?

- When there is excess capacity only allocate the variable cost of the resource.
- Alternatively, some of the fixed costs could be excluded from the transfer price.
- Using practical capacity instead of actual utilization in calculating the overhead rate.

### A caution: 

If you are not careful, you might use arithmetic to convince yourself that adding new products or services may __decrease fixed costs__.

No production decision, other than actually changing the fixed costs themselves, can change fixed costs.

### Allocating capacity cost: depreciation

- Not allocating some (or all) of the fixed cost can reduce the death spiral.
- For example, allocate only the fixed cost of the capacity actually being used. 
- If 40 percent excess capacity exists, allocate only 60 percent of the depreciation. 
- However, this solution to the death spiral creates other concerns.


### Allocating capacity cost: depreciation

- How much of the existing common resource should each user use? 
- The current capacity level was chosen for some reason!
- If excess capacity exists, any charge discourages its use. 
- Allocating accounting depreciation to users commits them to recovering at least the historical cost of the asset.

### The trade-off 

When allocating depreciation the firm trades off:

- the efficient investment in the common resource and
- its efficient utilization after acquisition.

### On one hand... on the other hand:

Charging depreciation helps control the overinvestment problem, but at the
expense of underutilizing the asset after acquisition. 

Most firms charge users for depreciation.

### Control of overinvestment is the habit of financial accounting systems

- Control of the overinvestment problem tends to dominate decision-making
  errors involving asset utilization (the death spiral). 
- This is another example of how accounting systems tend to favor control when
  confronted with a choice between control and decision making.
- This doesn't mean that it is the optimal decision.

## Getting this right matters!

## Cost Allocations at IBM: 

During the 1980s and early 1990s, IBM had the policy of allocating costs from
one line of business to another. Managers in those lines of business constantly
argued that some of their overhead should be carried by other IBM businesses. 

## Cost Allocations at IBM: 

IBM also typically allocated all of the R&D of a
new technology to the line of business first using the technology, and
subsequent users were able to utilize it for free. 

## Cost Allocations at IBM: 

This cost allocation system masked the true profitability of many IBM
businesses for years. IBM claimed it was making money in its PC business. 

## Cost Allocations at IBM: 

But in 1992, "as IBM began to move away from its funny allocation system, IBM
disclosed that its PC business was unprofitable." In 2004, IBM sold its PC
division to China-based Lenovo Group for \$1.75 billion.

## Allocating service department costs

Now that we're clear on all the things that can go wrong, lets try to do it!


### Allocating service department costs
![Usage flows among N service departments and M production departments.](alloc.png){width=75%}

## Example:

__Capacity of service departments used:__

|          | Telecoms | IT  | Cars | Trucks | Total |
|----------|----------|-----|------|--------|-------|
| Telecoms | 10%      | 20% | 40%  | 30%    | 100%  |
| IT       | 25%      | 15% | 35%  | 25%    | 100%  |

__Service department costs:__

|           | Cost      |
|-----------|-----------|
| Telecoms  | 2,000,000 |
| IT        | 6,000,000 |
| __Total__ | 8,000,000 |

## Direct method

### Direct allocation method:

|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Telecoms           | 40%/(40% + 30%) = 4/7  | 30%/(40% + 30%) = 3/7  | 100%  |
| IT                 | 35%/(35% + 25%) = 7/12 | 25%/(35% + 25%) = 5/12 | 100%  |

 
| __Allocated Costs__ | Cars                        | Trucks                      | Total |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Telecoms            | 4/7 $\times$ \$2 = \$1.143  | 3/7 $\times$ \$2 = \$0.857  | \$2   |
| IT                  | 7/12 $\times$ \$6 = \$3.500 | 5/12 $\times$ \$6 = \$2.500 | \$6   |
| Total               | \$4.643                     | \$3.357                     | \$8   |

### Good news, Bad news

- __Good news:__ everything is allocated
- __Bad news:__ this is not a good estimate of opportunity cost per unit of service

### What we know:

While we do not know the correct opportunity cost, we do know that the direct
allocation method excludes the service departments' use of other service
departments and therefore incorrectly states the opportunity cost of each
service department.


### Step-down method

### Does the order matter?

It may! In this case the difference in magnitudes is relatively minor.

_costs are in millions._

## Does the order matter?

### Does the order matter?

- The costs allocated to Cars and Trucks differ by only \$27,000 depending on whether telecommunications or IT  is chosen first.  
- The difference of \$27,000 is less than 1 percent of the total costs allocated. 

### Does the order matter?

- However, very different incentives result depending on which method is used. 
- Allocated costs are taxes, and taxes effect behavior.
- And these can lead to the __Death Spiral__ if the tax is too high!

### Illustration:

- To illustrate lets expand the telecommunications and IT example. 
- Suppose the allocation base in telecommunications is the number of telephones in each department, and 
- in IT the allocation base is the number of gigabytes of disk space used. 

### Illustration:

- Transfer prices are to be established for telephones and gigabytes. 
- Allocated costs will be used to compute the transfer prices.

### The allocation bases:

|          | Allocation base      |
|----------|----------------------|
| Telecomm | 3,000 Telephones     |
| IT       | 12 million gigabytes |

<!-- if there was more appitite for data analysis we sould spend a lot more time on teh critical question of how best to actually choose allocation bases. -->

### Cost allocated per phone

### Does the order matter?

The order can lead to large changes in the 'tax' on the allocation base!

##### Cost allocated per Giga of storage (Millions except cost per Gb)

### Consider the impact on behavior:

- The sequence of service departments in the step-down method changes the costs of each service.
- Because the cost per phone (which represents the transfer price) varies depending whether or  not it includes IT costs,
- the cost allocation scheme affects the decision of each department to add or drop phones.
- The same conclusions hold for the information technology department.

### Does the order matter?

- Note the wide variation in cost per gigabyte. 
- The cost varies from $0.588 per gigabyte under the step-down method with IT chosen first 
- to $0.895 under the step-down method with telecommunications chosen first. 

<!-- However, these same methods cause the cost-based transfer prices to vary by more than 140 percent for telephones (I $1,793 ÷ $741] ÷ $741) and more than 50 percent for gigabytes ([$0.895 ÷ $0.5881 ÷ $0.588). Why the discrepancy? Refer back to L Table 8-1. In this example, the Cars division uses roughly equal fractions of the two service departments (57 percent and 58 percent), and the Trucks division uses roughly equal fractions of the service departments (43 percent and 42 percent). Because these fractions are roughly the same in both departments, the total costs allocated to the divisions vary little across the various methods. However, the transfer prices per phone and gigabyte vary dramatically. In general, the allocation methods can yield substantial differences in amounts allocated. The numbers chosen for this example illustrate that transfer prices can vary greatly even when the cost allocation methods have little effect on the total amounts allocated. -->

### The central issues with the step-down method:

- The sequence used is arbitrary and large differences can result in the cost per unit of service using different sequences. 
- Also, the step-down method ignores the fact that although departments earlier in the sequence use service departments later in the sequence, earlier departments are not allocated these costs.
- Get this wrong and risk the death spiral.

## Step-Down Allocations and Medicare

### Step-Down Allocations and Medicare

- The U.S. Medicare system requires each hospital to file a Medicare Cost Report to get reimbursed for providing health care to Medicare patients. 
- To file this report, all cost centers in the hospital (administration, finance, human resources) that supply services to other cost centers and major functional services, such as the emergency department, surgery, and maternity, are ordered in a step-down sequence. 

### Step-Down Allocations and Medicare

- Each cost center allocates its cost using an allocation base. 
- For example, nursing administration costs might be allocated using nursing hours or nursing salaries in each functional service. 

### Step-Down Allocations and Medicare

- The Medicare Cost Report defines the order of the cost centers to be used in the step-down method but allows each hospital some discretion.
- For example, administration and general costs are usually allocated last.
-However, some hospitals move it up in the list. 

### Step-Down Allocations and Medicare

- The step-down method allocates the cost of each service center, as well as the costs stepped down to it, to the major functional services. 
- Many hospitals use the data generated by the Medicare Cost Report to set prices and to negotiate third-party contracts.
- __Note that the Medicare system is one of the few parts of the US health system that actually works!__
