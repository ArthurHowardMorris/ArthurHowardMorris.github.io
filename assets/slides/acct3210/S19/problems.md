## Absorption costing

### Absorption costing

We allocate costs for several reasons:

- decision management
- decision control
- cost-based contracts
- financial reporting
- taxes

If you take one thing from this course it is the following:
- __Do not assume that numbers produced for external reporting are useful for internal decisions.__
<!-- note for the future, we need to emphasize that the point of this course is to get people to stop using external numbers for internal decisions. -->
### Absorption costing: key features

- either directly traces or allocates __all manufacturing costs__ to products
- differentiates costs for products still in process, finished and sold
- inherently backward looking
- useful (and required) for financial accounting
- inclusion of fix costs requires care if used for decision making

## DeJure Scents


### Problem details:

DeJure Scents manufactures an aftershave and uses __process costing__. All
materials are added at the beginning of the process, and __conversion costs__ are
incurred uniformly over time. In May, DeJure started 15,000 gallons. There was
no beginning inventory. May's ending inventory of work-in-process was 2,000
gallons, which were 50 percent complete with respect to conversion costs. In
May, conversion costs were \$28,000 and materials costs were \$45,000.

### Questions:

1. Calculate the equivalent units of conversion and materials.
2. Calculate the cost per equivalent unit of conversion and materials.
3. Calculate the cost of the ending inventory and the cost transferred to
   finished goods inventory.

### Concepts:

1. Process costing 
2. Conversion costs
3. Equivalent units


### Process costing 

- Useful when production is a _process_ that produces identical units.
- Liquids like petrol, aftershave, perfume, and orange juice are classic examples.
- We track product in three places:
1. beginning work-in-process inventory, 
2. units started and finished this period, and 
3. ending work-in-process inventory.

### Conversion costs

- capture the cost of __converting__ direct materials into finished goods
- labor and overhead (these may or may not be fixed)
- these are the cost we need to _allocate_

### Equivalent units

- we use equivalent units to state the amount of completed work in terms of finished units
- e.g. if three units are one third complete then we have one equivalent unit

### Setup:

| Physical flow:       | Gallons | E.U Conversion | E.U. Materials |
|----------------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| WIP, begin.          | 0       | 0              | 0              |
| Units started        | 15,000  |                |                |
| Units to account for | 15,000  |                |                |

_Note: E.U. is 'equivalent units.'

### WIP-Effective Units

|                               | Gallons | E.U Conversion | E.U. Materials |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Work-In-Process, ending (50%) | 2,000   | ?              | ?              |

_What information do we have to help us fill in this table?_

### WIP-Effective Units

|                               | Gallons | E.U Conversion | E.U. Materials |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Work-In-Process, ending (50%) | 2,000   | ?              | 2,000          |

> All materials are added at the beginning of the process. 

### WIP-Effective Units

|                               | Gallons | E.U Conversion    | E.U. Materials |
|-------------------------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Work-In-Process, ending (50%) | 2,000   | .5 $\times$ 2,000 | 2,000          |

> Conversion costs are incurred uniformly over time.


### Units accounted for 

|                               | Gallons | E.U Conversion | E.U. Materials |
|-------------------------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Work-In-Process, ending (50%) | 2,000   | 1,000          | 2,000          |
| Completed                     | 13,000  | 13,000         | 13,000         |
| Units accounted for           | 15,000  | 14,000         | 15,000         |

### Cost per equivalent unit

|                | Total    | E.U. Conversion | E.U. Materials |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Units          | 15,000   | 14,000          | 15,000         |
| Costs          | \$73,000 | \$28,000        | \$45,000       |
| per equi. unit |          | \$2.00          | \$3.00         |

### Overhead rate:

- The conversion cost per equivalent unit is where the overhead allocation
   occurs.
- Adjusting this rate in response to short-term changes in production can cause
   a death spiral! 
   - For example: Imagine that your machinery breaks and you end up incurring
      that same conversion costs (labor and overhead) such that only 7,000
      effective units have been converted, but for the same cost. Now the
      conversion cost is \$4.00 per unit. Should you use this number for future
      planning? Or should you continue using \$2.00.

### Cost of inventory and transfer to finished goods

|                          | Gallons  | E.U Conversion      | E.U. Materials      |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Work-In-Process, ending  | \$ 8,000 | \$2,000             | \$6,000             |
|                          |          | $(\$2\times1000)$   | $(\$3\times2000)$   |
| Finished goods inventory | \$65,000 | \$26,000            | \$39,000            |
|                          |          | $(\$2\times13,000)$ | $(\$3\times13,000)$ |
| Total costs              | \$73,000 | \$28,000            | \$45,000            |

### Did we learn anything interesting here?

- The technique is relatively straightforward.
- But what are the \$2.00 and \$3.00 amounts doing?

### But what are the \$2.00 and \$3.00 amounts doing?

- If we are doing tax or financial accounting then they just track the flow of
   costs through the firm, and link them to revenue. (important but not
   interesting)
- What if we are trying to use these numbers to communicate information to
   internal decision makers?
- Can we use these numbers to align incentives?
- What does a cost number communicate if you use it internally?
- _It should capture the marginal cost of the decision to produce._ Does it?


## Kitchen Rite: Outsourcing and job order costing

### Job order costing

- Classic example is shipbuilding.
- Products are produced in batches which each require different raw materials
   and classes of labor.

### Kitchen Rite

Kitchen Rite is considering outsourcing the production of a steel chassis that
is used in a kitchen appliance. Two thousand chassis are produced per month. An
outside vendor will supply an identical chassis for \$9.90. The chassis is
manufactured in two steps. A stamping press punches out the part from sheet
metal, bends the sides, and cuts holes in it, all in one operation. Then a
welding machine welds the corners. Both the welding and stamping machines are
used to produce only this one chassis model.

### Job cost sheet

The following job order cost sheet summarizes the costs of producing a single
chassis.

|                           | Cost per Unit |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Steel Plate               | \$4.75        |
| Direct Labor:             |               |
| - Stamping (\$20/hr)      | 1.60          |
| - Welding (\$30/hr)       | 2.50          |
| Overhead:                 |               |
| - Stamping (depreciation) | 3.60          |
| - Welding (lease payment) | 2.15          |
| General plant             | 5.90          |
|                           | \$ 20.50      |

### Machine details

The stamping machine is old and has little economic value. A used equipment
dealer is willing to remove the machine and haul it away at no cost. The
stamping machine was purchased 13 years ago for \$1,728,000. For both tax and
reporting purposes, it is being depreciated using a 20-year life, straight-line
method, and it has zero salvage value. The welding machine is leased for \$4,300
per month, and the lease can be canceled at any time and the machine returned.
However, an early termination penalty of \$1,800 per month for the next 42
months must be paid.

### Plant overhead

General plant overhead consists primarily of the allocated cost of depreciation
on the plant, property taxes, and fire insurance on the plant. Kitchen Rite
currently has excess plant space. The manufacturing space freed up if the
chassis is outsourced has no other use.

### Labor

Employees are unionized and have a clause in their contract that prevents the
firm from firing them if their jobs are eliminated due to outsourcing. The
employees working on the stamping machine will be placed on indefinite furlough
at 75 percent of their current pay. The employees operating the welding machine
can be reassigned to other positions in the firm as job openings occur. Given
the high demand for welders, these reassignments will occur within a few weeks
of outsourcing the chassis.

### Taxes
Kitchen Rite has a tax loss for the current and the previous two years.

### Questions
Should Kitchen Rite outsource the chassis? Support your recommendation with a
clear financial analysis of the facts.

### Consider:

This problem illustrates that not all direct labor costs are incremental and not all fixed overhead costs are sunk.

### Current cash flows

The current cash outflows of manufacturing the chassis per unit are:

|                           |         |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Direct material           | \$ 4.75 |
| Direct labor:             |         |
| Stamping                  | 1.60    |
| Welding                   | 2.50    |
| Overhead:                 |         |
| Stamping                  | 0       |
| Welding (\$4,300 รท 2,000) | 2.15    |
| Total                     | \$11.00 |


### Cash outflows if we outsource

|                                                   |          |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Purchased chassis                                 | \$  9.90 |
| Stamping labor (75% ร 1.60)                       | 1.20     |
| Welding lease early termination (\$1,800 รท 2,000) | .90      |
| Total                                             | \$12.00  |

### Recommendation:

__Do not outsource because the net cash flows of outsourcing are lower than
continuing to manufacture the chassis internally.__

### Are these numbers that we can use?

- For taxes, reporting, and contracting: YES.
- For the outsourcing decision: NO!
- Absorption costing (i.e. financial accounting) does not capture the effect of production choices on cost.
- In general absorption costing is _inappropriate_ for the following decisions:
   - Choice to process further.
   - Discontinuing a product line (closing a division).
   - Outsourcing a process.
