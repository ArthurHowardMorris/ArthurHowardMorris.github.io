### Everything starts with a budget

## Example: Sandy Cove Bank

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Sandy Cove is a new small commercial bank in Sandy Cove, Michigan.
- The bank limits interest rate risk by matching the maturity of its assets to
  the maturity of its liabilities.
- By maintaining a spread between interest rates charged and interest rates
  paid, the bank plans to earn a small income.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Management establishes a flexible budget based on interest rates for each
  department.
- The Boat and Car Loan Department offers five-year loans.
- It matches certificates of deposit (CDs) against car and boat loans.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Given all the uncertainty about interest rates, management believes that
  five-year savings interest rates could vary between 2 percent and 16 percent
  for the coming year. (_Note: 'Given' in this sentence embeds a critical
  management accounting activity: forecasting._)
- The savings rate is the rate paid on CD savings accounts.
- The loan rate is the rate charged on auto and boat loans. 

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Expected new demand for fixed-rate, five-vear loans and the new supply of
  fixed-rate, five-year savings accounts at various interest rates.

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand  | Savings Rate | Savings Supply |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 6%        | \$12,100,000 | 2            | \$ 4,700,000%  |
| 7%        | 10,000,000   | 3            | 5,420,000      |
| 8%        | 8,070,000    | 4            | 8,630,000      |
| 9%        | 6,030,000    | 5            | 9,830,000      |
| 10%       | 4,420,000    | 6            | 11,800,000     |

- There are no loans from previous years. Note that the department maintains a
  4 percent spread between loan and savings rates to cover processing, loan
  default, and overhead.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- The amount of new loans granted is always the lesser of the loan demand and
  loan supply.
- For simplicity, this bank may lend 100 percent of deposits.
- In practice, this rate is set by policy makers and regulators not the bank itself.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Although rates are set nationally, the bank may pay or charge slightly
  different rates to limit demand or boost supply as needed in its local
  market.
- The Boat and Car Loan Department incurs processing, loan default, and
  overhead expenses related to these accounts.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- The first two expenses vary, depending on the dollar amount of the accounts.
- The annual processing expense is budgeted to be 1.5 percent of the loan
  accounts. 
- Default expense is budgeted at 1 percent of the amount loaned per year.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Again, loans and savings would ideally be the same.
- Overhead expenses are estimated to be \$30,000 for the year, regardless of the
  amount loaned.

### SCB Question 1

1. Calculate the processing, loan default, and overhead expenses for each possible interest rate.

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  |
| 7%        | 10          | 3%           | 5.42           | 5.42      |
| 8%        | 8.07        | 4%           | 8.63           | 8.07      |
| 9%        | 6.03        | 5%           | 9.83           | 6.03      |
| 10%       | 4.42        | 6%           | 11.8           | 4.42      |

### SCB Solution 1

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans | Processing Expenses |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  | \$70,500            |
| 7%        | 10          | 3%           | 5.42           | 5.42      | 81,300              |
| 8%        | 8.07        | 4%           | 8.63           | 8.07      | 121,050             |
| 9%        | 6.03        | 5%           | 9.83           | 6.03      | 90,450              |
| 10%       | 4.42        | 6%           | 11.8           | 4.42      | 66,300              |

- Processing is 1.5% of loan accounts

### SCB Solution 1

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans | Processing Expenses | Default Exp |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  | \$70,500            | \$47,000    |

- These are the budgeted expenses, this is the foundation of financing plans to
  make sure that these resources are in place when they are needed.
- In this case it is the deposits that need to be in place for the lending to
  happen.
  
### Logical flow

### SCB Question 2

2. Create an annual budgeted income statement for five-year loans and deposits
   for the Boat and Car Loan Department given a savings interest rate of 4
   percent. Remember to match supply and demand.

|                     |                   |           |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Interest income     | \$8,070,000 × 8%= | \$645,600 |
| Interest expense    | \$8,070,000 × 4%= | 322,800   |
| Net interest income |                   | \$322,800 |
| Fixed overhead      |                   | 30,000    |
| Processing expense  |                   | 121,050   |
| Default expense     |                   | 80,700    |
| Net income          |                   | \$ 91,050 |

### SCB Question 3

3. Table 2 shows the actual income statement for the Boat and Car Loan
   Department. Included are the actual loans and savings for the same period.
   Calculate the variances and provide a possible explanation.

|                     | Budget    | Actual      |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Interest income     | \$645,600 | \$ 645,766  |
| Interest expense    | 322,800   | 314,360     |
| Net interest income | \$322,800 | \$ 331,406  |
| Fixed overhead      | 30,000    | 30,200      |
| Processing expense  | 121,050   | 130,522     |
| Default expense     | 80,700    | 77,800      |
| Net income          | \$ 91,050 | \$ 92,884   |
| Loans               | 8,070,000 | \$8,062,000 |
| Deposits            | 8,070,000 | \$8,123,000 |

### SCB Solution 3

|                     | Budget    | Actual      | Fav. (Unfav.) Variance |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Interest income     | \$645,600 | \$ 645,766  | \$ 166                 |
| Interest expense    | 322,800   | 314,360     | 8,440                  |
| Net interest income | \$322,800 | \$ 331,406  | \$ 8,606               |
| Fixed overhead      | 30,000    | 30,200      | (200)                  |
| Processing expense  | 121,050   | 130,522     | (9,472)                |
| Default expense     | 80,700    | 77,800      | 2,900                  |
| Net income          | \$ 91,050 | \$ 92,884   | 1,834                  |
| Loans               | 8,070,000 | \$8,062,000 | \$ (8,000)             |
| Deposits            | 8,070,000 | \$8,123,000 | \$(53,000)             |

### SCB Solution 3

- Even though loans were lower and deposits were higher than expected, interest
  income was higher and interest expense was lower than expected.
- The answer can be obtained by calculating the average interest rates earned
  and paid.

### SCB Solution 3

- On \$8,062,000 worth of loans, Sandy Cove earned \$645,766 interest, or 8.01
  percent (0.01 percent more than expected).
- Similarly, it paid only 3.87 percent (0.13 percent less) on deposits.

### SCB Solution 3

- Therefore, the net interest income variance of \$8,606 is a combination of
  two effects: the variance in the actual loans and deposits (quantity) and the
  variance in the interest rates (price).
- The combined effects are a favorable interest income variance, a favorable
  interest expense variance, and an overall favorable net interest income
  variance.

### SCB Solution 3

- At a savings interest rate of 4 percent, there is an excess supply of
  deposits over demand for loans.
- The Boat and Car Loan Department lowered the interest rate on deposits to
  stem additional deposits.

### SCB Solution 3

- The increase in the interest rate on loans can be attributed only to an 
  increase in the demand for loans, which resulted in the department charging a
  slightly higher average interest rate.
- The higher processing expense could be related to the higher number of
  accounts processed and improvements in the default rate.
- That is, the favorable default expense could be attributed to an improved
  screening process-related to spending more on processing.

## Terminology

Before we dig into understanding variances, we need to define a couple of terms.

### Standards vs. Budgets

- Budgeted costs and standard costs are the same thing.
- You can think of a 'budget' as the entire financial and operational plan.
- You can think of the 'standards' as all of the individual forecasts that go into the budget.
- Though the words are used interchangeably.

### Standards vs. Actuals

- Standards are our predictions (generated from our model of costs)
- Actuals are what we observe (generated by reality)

Note that this definition is related to the data selection issue on the mid-term. 

### Variance:

Total Variance = Actual Cost - Standard Cost

## Decomposing Variances

### Total Var. into Price & Quantity Vars

- Start with this:

> Total variance is equal to actual cost minus standard cost.

### Total Var. into Price & Quantity Vars

- Define a few variables:

|                | Symbol |          | Subscript |
|----------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Total Variance | $TV$   | Actual   | $a$       |
| Quantity       | $Q$    | Standard | $s$       |
| Price          | $P$    |          |           |

- _This is all we need to decompose any variance into it's price and volume components._
