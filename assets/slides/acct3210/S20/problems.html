<h3>Q2:</h3>
<p>Aspen View is considering switching from variable costing to
absorption costing. Would this year’s net income from Peak 32 sunglasses
be higher or lower using absorption costing? Explain.</p>
</section>
<section id="q2-solution" class="slide level3">
<h3>Q2: Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Income would have been <strong>higher</strong> had Aspen View used
absorption costing.</li>
<li>Under absorption costing, some of the fixed manufacturing costs
would have been allocated to the ending inventory rather than all of
them being written off to cost of goods sold.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="q3" class="slide level3">
<h3>Q3:</h3>
<p>Suppose Aspen View uses absorption costing. If, instead of producing
5,300 pairs of Peak 32s it produced only 5,000, would net income from
Peak 32 sunglasses be higher or lower from the smaller production
compared to the larger production? Explain.</p>
</section>
<section id="q3-solution" class="slide level3">
<h3>Q3: Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assuming constant variable cost per unit, income would have been
lower.</li>
<li>With fewer units produced, less fixed costs would have been
allocated to the ending inventory under absorption costing.</li>
<li>The preceding statement assumes variable cost per unit is
constant.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="q4" class="slide level3">
<h3>Q4:</h3>
<p>Aspen View has an opportunity cost of capital of 20 percent. What is
the cost of producing 5,300 pairs of Peak 32s instead of 4,900
pairs?</p>
</section>
<section id="q4-solution" class="slide level3">
<h3>Q4: Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assuming that they can sell the 400 pairs of sunglasses in
inventory, the cost of overproducing is the sum of:
<ol type="1">
<li>the additional warehousing costs plus</li>
<li><span class="math inline">400 × $15.50 × 20% × <em>ξ</em></span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>ξ</em></span> is the fraction of the
year the glasses are held until being sold.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This calculation assumes that all of the variable advertising,
distribution, and selling expenses are incurred when the sunglasses are
sold, not manufactured.</li>
<li>This illustrates both the overproduction incentive from full
absorption costing and the improvement from variable costing.</li>

<p>Senior management at Navisky, including Mr. Hoffman, expects to sell
about 1,200 units of the environmental GPS device this year. However,
they have considerable discretion in setting production levels. Their
plant has excess capacity and can produce up to 1,500 environmental
devices without seeing any increase in the variable manufacturing costs
per unit.</p>
<p>Navisky uses a traditional absorption costing system to absorb
manufacturing overhead into product costs for inventory valuation and to
calculate earnings for internal compensation purposes as well as
external reporting. At the beginning of the current fiscal year, there
was no beginning inventory of the environmental GPS devices.</p>

<p>Mr. Hoffman, because he expects to retire next year and hence will
not have to deal with any excess inventory, has an incentive to over
produce. The table below indicates that given sales of 1200 units
Mr. Hoffman would like to produce about 1,360 units. At 1,360 units,
expected earnings are about €1,401,647, or just above the bonus cap of
€1,400,000. So to maximize his bonus, Mr. Hoffman will want to produce
1,360 units, or 160 more than he expects to sell.</p>

<h3>Q2:</h3>
<p>Suppose Mr. Hoffman’s bonus calculation was based on net income after
including a charge for inventory holding costs at 20 percent of the
ending inventory value. In other words, his bonus is 5 percent of net
income in excess of $850,000 up to $1,400,000 where net income includes
a 20 percent inventory holding cost. How many units of the environmental
GPS device would Mr. Hoffman like to see produced if he expects to sell
1,200 devices this year?</p>

<p>With an inventory holding cost of 20 percent deducted from earnings,
Mr. Hoffman will prefer to produce 1,420 units because at this
production level (and given sales of 1,200 units) Mr. Hoffman will reach
the bonus cap of €27,500.</p>

<h3>Q3:</h3>
<p>Explain why your answers in parts (a) and (b) differ, if they do.</p>

<section id="q3-solution-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Q3: Solution</h3>
<p>Interestingly, charging Mr. Hoffman an inventory holding cost of 20
percent actually causes him to over produce even more. Without the 20
percent inventory charge Mr. Hoffman only has to produce about 1,360
units (or 160 more than he expects to sell) to reach the €1.4 million
earnings cap. But with the 20 percent inventory charge, Mr. Hoffman
needs to produce about 1,420 (or 220 more than he expects to sell) to
reach the cap. Hence, including the inventory holding charge has the
perverse incentive of actually causing Mr. Hoffman to over produce even
more. The reason for this is the existence of the bonus cap, and the
fact that the 20 percent charge on inventory is less than the reduction
in average fixed costs charged to cost of goods sold.</p>

<h3>Q4:</h3>
<p>How many units of the environmental GPS device would Mr. Hoffman like
to see produced, assuming he expects to sell 1,200 devices this year if
Navisky’s net income is calculated using variable costing and net income
includes a 20 percent inventory holding cost?</p>

</table>
<p>Under variable costing and a 20 percent inventory holding cost,
Mr. Hoffman will not over produce. He will produce exactly what he
intends to sell, 1,200 devices. If he over produces under variable
costing, earnings falls, and hence his bonus is lower.</p>
