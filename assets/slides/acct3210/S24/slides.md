  - Separation of ownership and control
  - The nature of the principal agent problem.
  - Risk aversion and incentives

### Economics of agency

<!--TODO: make pdf versions of these-->

  <!-- Note that the details of the Rothwell problem will not be tested. -->

## Section 3: Cost Allocation

### Lectures 13 & 14: Transfer Pricing

- Vik-Giger
- Why do we need transfer prices?
  - Overconsumption of common resources.
  - Transmit information and incentives within a decentralized firm.
- Do you understand why the transfer price is useful for decentralized decisions
  in questions 1 & 2? [__(Starting on Slide 6)__](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S14/vik_solution_slides.pdf)
- Do you understand why the transfer price is not useful for decentralized
decisions in question 3? [__(Starting on Slide 18)__](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S14/vik_solution_slides.pdf)

### Lectures 13 & 14: Cost Allocation

- The key concept here is that cost allocations (including transfer prices) function as 'Pigouvian' taxes.
  - Taxes reduce the taxed activity.
  - Negative taxes are subsidies, and increase the subsidised activity.

### Lecture 16: Cost Allocation

- __Step-down method:__ I will not ask you about the step-down method. Beyond
asking you what is wrong with it.
  - This method is 'unstable', 'indeterminate' or 'inaccurate', because the same
  underlying economics can produce very different numbers depending on the order
  in which you allocate the costs. There is no theoretical reason to prefer one
  order over the other.
  - Inaccurate, if the interdepartmental support consumption is large and
  unbalanced (i.e. consumption varies widely across all departments), then this
  method can missallocate costs by a large amount.

### Lecture 18: Cost Allocation

- __Reciprocal Method:__ I won't ask you to calculate the allocations, but I may
ask you about how to set it up and interpret it.
  - If given a table of costs, you should be able to set up the equations and
  describe how to solve them.

Review the slides ([__Posted here__](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S18/costallocation3_slides.pdf)) starting with the "reciprocal method" slide. Focus on how to assemble the information and the steps, rather than the calculation. (_If you need a calculator, you will not need to do it!_)

### Lectures 19 & 20: Absorption Costing

- I will not ask you about the examples in lecture 19. I will focus on the
examples from lecture 20.
- Navisky, Aspen, Kothari problems (don't worry, I won't ask all of them)

### Navisky notes

- [Application of fixed overhead](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S20/problems.pdf)  <!-- html#/q1-solution-1) -->

- You can think of the formula for fixed manufacturing overhead applied to cost of goods sold as:

$$FMO=OHR \times Q_{sold}$$

- OHR is the overhead rate: $OHR=TOH/Q_{made}$
- OH is the total overhead, 2.7 million in this case
- $Q_{made}$ is the number of units produced, and $Q_{sold}$ is the number of units sold.

### Navisky notes

- [The cost per unit of inventory](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S20/problems.pdf) <!-- html#/q2-solution-4) --> is the sum of the overhead applied to the inventory and the [variable manufacturing costs](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S20/problems.pdf) <!-- .html#/navisky-data) -->

- $VC/unit=380$
- The fixed overhead applied to each unit of inventory is just the overhead rate: $OHR=TOH/Q_{made}$

### Navisky: Think about the structure of the incentives

- What roles in determining incentives could the size of the factory play?
  - Limits overproduction to 1500 units. If we assume that the manager does not have the ability to unilaterally expand the factory, if they do then we do not have enough information to determine the costs and benefits from the company and manager perspectives.

- What roles in determining incentives is the bonus cap playing?
  - Limiting the bonus to &euro;27,000

- What role is the bonus itself playing?
- What role is the accounting method playing?
- How do these things interact and what would happen if they were relaxed?

### Activity Based Costing

Conceptual understanding of how activity based costing improves on simple absorption costing.

1. More granular information leads to more accurate cost allocations.
2. More accurate allocations provide better information via transfer prices.
3. More accurate allocations connect incentives (a la Pigou) to the actual costs that the firm incurs.

### Budgets/Standard Costs/Variances

There will be a section of multiple choice question based on these.

- A few students asked for the who test to be MC, I'm not allowed to do that.
I'm sorry. Also, writing MC questions is so absolutely apocalyptically
stultifyingly soul crushingly boring that I can't possibly write any more of
these than I have.

### Variance

Total Variance = Actual Cost - Standard Cost

### Disaggregation of direct cost variances

Direct cost (labor and materials) can be disaggregated into Price and Quantity variances using the flexible budget.

### Disaggregation of direct cost variances

| Total Variance                      | Actual DM Cost   | Flexible Budget  | Standard DM Cost |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| $(Q_a\times P_a) - (P_s\times Q_s)$ | $P_a \times Q_a$ | $P_s \times Q_a$ | $P_s \times Q_s$ |

| Total Variance                      | Price Variance                    | Quantity Variance                |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| $(Q_a\times P_a) - (P_s\times Q_s)$ | $P_a \times Q_a - P_s \times Q_a$ | $P_s \times Q_a- P_s \times Q_s$ |
| $[Q_a(P_a-P_s)] +  [P_s(Q_a-Q_s)]$  | $Q_a(P_a-P_s)$                    | $P_s(Q_a-Q_s)$                   |

### Disaggregation of overhead cost variances

__Total Overhead Variance = Actual Overhead Costs - Overhead Absorbed__
$$AOH - (OHR \times SV) = AOH - (OHR \times SV)
$$\$2,300,000 - \$2,291,600 = \$8,400

__Interpretation:__

- Overhead is 'Underabsorbed', if actual > absorbed
- Overhead is 'Overabsorbed', if actual < absorbed

### Disaggregation  Overhead Variance

__Total Overhead Variance = Actual Overhead - Overhead Absorbed__

- Overhead spending variance = Actual overhead - Flexible budget at actual volume
- OSV = AOH - FB@AV
- Overhead efficiency variance = Flexible budget at actual volume - Flexible budget at standard volume
- OEV = FB@AV - FB@SV
- Overhead volume variance =  Flexible budget at standard volume - Overhead Absorbed
- OVV = FB@SV - OA

### Disaggregation  Overhead Variance

| TOV | = | AOH |     |       | -   |       |     | OA |
|-----|---|-----|-----|-------|-----|-------|-----|----|
| OSV | = | AOH | -   | FB@AV |     |       |     |    |
| OEV | = |     |     | FB@AV | -   | FB@SV |     |    |
| OVV | = |     |     |       |     | FB@SV | -   | OA |

### More detailed definitions:

| TOV | = | AOH |     |                     | -   |                     |     | $OHR \times SV$ |
|-----|---|-----|-----|---------------------|-----|---------------------|-----|-----------------|
| OSV | = | AOH | -   | FOH+(VOH$\times$AV) |     |                     |     |                 |
| OEV | = |     |     | FOH+(VOH$\times$AV) | -   | FOH+(VOH$\times$SV) |     |                 |
| OVV | = |     |     |                     |     | FOH+(VOH$\times$SV) | -   | $OHR \times SV$ |

### Disaggregation  Overhead Variance

- Overhead spending variance: OSV = AOH - FB@AV
  - This is the variance due to change in the cost of the overhead itself.
- Overhead efficiency variance: OEV = FB@AV - FB@SV
  - This is the variance due to differences in how efficiently we used the overhead.
- Overhead volume variance: OVV = FB@SV - OA
  - This is the variance due to the effect of volume on the overhead allocation.
