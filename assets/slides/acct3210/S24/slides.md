title: "Review Session"

### Overview:

- Comprehensive
- 2 hours
- 2 sections
- Each section will have 6 numbered parts, of which you may skip one. This means that we will drop the worst part from each of the two sections.

### Overview:

- Each part will include information you will use to answer the questions in
  that part. 
- These questions will be indicated with letters: (a) if there is one, (b) if
  there is a second, and so forth.
- The exam is closed book and notes.

<!-- ### PUT THE NOTE HERE -->

### Section 1:

- This will cover the information that was on the mid-term.
- The original five parts will be repeated with minor edits.
- There will be one additional question.

#### Section 1 Part 1: Cost functions
    - Average cost,  marginal cost, incremental costs.
    - When do they exist, when do they differ, when do the differences matter.

#### Section 1 Part 2: Regression and Plotting

- [Cost Estimation Lecture](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S3/Lecture3CostEstimation.slides.html)
- [Cost Estimation Excel Example](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S3/Problem2and3.xlsx)

Practice plotting data and adding a trend line using your tool of choice. 

#### Section 1 Part 3: Interpret Plots of Data and Trends

- Review the characteristics of good model fit.
- Consider both how to use intuition to interpret the model, and how to use the
  relation between the data and the model (or trend line) to evaluate the model.
- Remember that just because data is on the graph, does not mean that we should
  be using it.
- The details of this question will come from the homework assignment in the excel example.

#### Section 1 Part 4: Constrained Maximization

- Be able to set up an objective function.
- Identify the choice variables.
- Identify the constraints.
- Understand what it means for a constraint to bind, or to be slack.
- Understand shadow constraints, and explain their real world meaning. 
- The details from this question will come from the [Non-linear programming lecture](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S4/lecture4nonlinearProgramming.slides.html)

#### Section 1 Part 5: Multiple Choice questions about taxes.

### Key tax concepts:

1. Assets, investments, and projects all have different pre-tax returns ($r$).
2. Tax rates $t$ vary across individuals, jurisdictions, organizations, and assets.
3. pre-tax returns $r$ correspond to post tax returns $r(1-t)$ 
4. When preferential tax treatment increases demand for a tax favored asset it's price increases and/or the return to holding it decreases. This price change is an _implicit_ tax.
5. When tax payers use organizational forms like pensions and insurance policies to avoid taxes it is called _organizational form arbitrage_.
6. When high-tax tax payers issue taxable debt to finance the purchase of tax free debt (e.g. municipal bonds in the US) issued by low-tax tax payers (e.g. US non-profit universities) it is called _clientele arbitrage_.
7. The depreciation _tax shield_ is the present value of the reduction in tax payments afforded by the depreciation deduction.
8. The value of the tax shield $TS$ is a function of the investment $x$, the cash flow it generates $k$, the risk-free rate of return $r$, the tax rate $t$, and the depreciation rate $d$.
$$TS=f(x,k,t,d,r)$$
9.  $TS$ is increasing in both  $d$ and $t$.

#### Section 1 Part 6: Data Science work flow

- Review the "A 'Data Science' Workflow" Section of the [Cost Estimation Lecture](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S3/Lecture3CostEstimation.slides.html#/1/1)
- You should have a sense for the flow of the "management accounting" data work flow.

### Section 2 - What we've covered since the midterm

#### Economics of agency

- The following issues will be covered:
  - Separation of ownership and control
  - The nature of the principal agent problem.
  - Risk aversion and incentives

- These will be questions about the concepts from:
  - [Incentives and Compensation](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S10/session10incentives.slides.html) and 
  - [Examples](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S11/MoreIncentives.slides.html)

  Note that the details of the Rothwell problem will not be tested.

#### Section 2 Part 2: Transfer Pricing

- Vik-Giger
- Why do we need transfer prices?
  - Overconsumption of common resources.
  - Transmit information and incentives within a decentralized firm.

#### Section 2 Part 3: Cost Allocation

- The key concept here is that cost allocations (including transfer prices) function as 'Pigouvian' taxes
  - Taxes reduce the taxed activity
  - Negative taxes are subsidies, and increase the subsidised activity

#### Section 2 Part 4: Absorption Costing

- Navisky, Aspen, Kothari problems (don't worry, I won't ask all of them)
- add the breakdowns to navisky TODO

#### Section 2 Part 5: Activity Based Costing

Conceptual understanding of how activity based costing improves on simple aborption costing 

#### Section 2 Part 6: Budgets/Standard Costs

Concept on budgets

Line up the breakdown of the variances
