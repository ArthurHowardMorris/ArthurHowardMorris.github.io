## US subsidiary

- Vik-Giger Corporation, headquartered in the U.S., manufactures
  state-of-the-art milling machines.
- It has two marketing subsidiaries, one in Brazil and one in Switzerland, that
  sell its products. 
- Vik-Giger is considering building one new machine, at a cost of \$500,000. 
- There is no market for the equipment in the United States. 

## Brazilian subsidiary

- The equipment can be sold in Brazil for \$1,000,000, but the Brazilian
  subsidiary would incur transportation and modification costs of \$200,000. 

## Swiss subsidiary

- Alternatively, the equipment can be sold in Switzerland for \$950,000, but
  the Swiss subsidiary would incur transportation and modification costs of
  \$250,000.

## Decision

- The U.S. company can sell the equipment either to its Brazilian subsidiary or
  to its Swiss subsidiary but not to both. 
- Vik-Giger Corporation and its subsidiaries operate in a very decentralized
  manner. Managers in each company have considerable autonomy, with each
  division manager interested in maximizing his or her own division’s income.

## Question 1:

- From the viewpoint of Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries taken together, should
   Vik-Giger Corporation manufacture the equipment? 
   - (a) If it does, where should it sell the equipment to maximize corporate operating income?
   - (b) What would the operating income for Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries be from the sale? Ignore any income tax effects.

## Question 2:

- What range of transfer prices will result in achieving the actions determined
  to be optimal in requirement 1? Explain your answer. 

## Question 3:

- The effective income tax rates for this transaction follow: 40\% in the
  United States, 60\% in Brazil, and 15\% in Switzerland. The tax authorities
  in the three countries are uncertain about the cost of the intermediate
  product and will allow any transfer price between \$500,000 and \$700,000. If
  Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries want to maximize after-tax operating income:
   - (a) should the equipment be manufactured and 
   - (b) where and at what price should it be transferred?

## Question 4:

- Now suppose each manager acts autonomously to maximize his or her own
  subsidiary’s after-tax operating income, and the subsidiaries are given the
  freedom to negotiate their own transfer price.
  - Which subsidiary will get the product and at what price? 
  - Is your answer the same as your answer in 3? Explain why or why not.
