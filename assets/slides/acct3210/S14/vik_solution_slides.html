<section id="us-subsidiary" class="slide level2">
<h2>US subsidiary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vik-Giger Corporation, headquartered in the U.S., manufactures
state-of-the-art milling machines.</li>
<li>It has two marketing subsidiaries, one in Brazil and one in
Switzerland, that sell its products.</li>
<li>Vik-Giger is considering building one new machine, at a cost of
$500,000.</li>
<li>There is no market for the equipment in the United States.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="brazilian-subsidiary" class="slide level2">
<h2>Brazilian subsidiary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The equipment can be sold in Brazil for $1,000,000, but the
Brazilian subsidiary would incur transportation and modification costs
of $200,000.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="swiss-subsidiary" class="slide level2">
<h2>Swiss subsidiary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, the equipment can be sold in Switzerland for
$950,000, but the Swiss subsidiary would incur transportation and
modification costs of $250,000.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="decision" class="slide level2">
<h2>Decision</h2>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. company can sell the equipment either to its Brazilian
subsidiary or to its Swiss subsidiary but not to both.</li>
<li>Vik-Giger Corporation and its subsidiaries operate in a very
decentralized manner. Managers in each company have considerable
autonomy, with each division manager interested in maximizing his or her
own division’s income.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Question 1:</h2>
<ul>
<li>From the viewpoint of Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries taken together,
should Vik-Giger Corporation manufacture the equipment?
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>If it does, where should it sell the equipment to maximize corporate
operating income?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>What would the operating income for Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries
be from the sale? Ignore any income tax effects.</li>

<p>To answer this question just calculate the operating income that
Vik-Giger gets in either case.</p>

<ul>
<li>What range of transfer prices will result in achieving the actions
determined to be optimal in requirement 1? Explain your answer.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="consider-the-following-status-quo" class="slide level2">
<h2>Consider the following <em>status quo</em>:</h2>
</section>
<section id="brazil" class="slide level2">
<h2>1. Brazil</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Brazilian department wants to sell the machine in their market,
and capture 800,000 of operating income. This is what shareholders of
the combined entity also prefer as they get 300,000 operating
income.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="switzerland" class="slide level2">
<h2>2. Switzerland</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Swiss department also wants to sell the machine in their market,
and capture 750,000 of operating income. This is sub-optimal from the
perspective of the combined entity as they can capture more operating
income by selling in the Brazilian market.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="us" class="slide level2">
<h2>3. US</h2>
<ul>
<li>The manufacturing division in the US would prefer not to produce the
product in either case as they only stand to loose 500,000.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-we-need-from-the-transfer-price" class="slide level2">
<h2>What we need from the transfer price:</h2>
<p>Vik-Giger must centralize the decision, or choose a transfer price at
which (1) the US division agrees to produce, (2) the Brazilian division
is willing to transport and market the machine, and (3) the Swiss
division prefers not to transport and market the machine.</p>
</section>
<section id="we-can-use-a-negotiation-to-solve-this-problem"
class="slide level2">
<h2>We can use a negotiation to solve this problem:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Imagine that Vik-Giger headquarters sends the three division CEOs to
a resort in the Aleutian Islands (where it is cold so they will stay
inside and negotiate) and asks them to choose a transfer price.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-us-division-decides-to-run-a-simple-auction"
class="slide level2">
<h2>The US division decides to run a simple auction:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The US set the reserve at 500,000 as this is their cost.</li>
<li>Switzerland drops out of the bidding at 700,000 as they start to
loose money beyond this point.</li>
<li>Brazil’s winning bid is 700,000, this is the low end of the range of
transfer prices that yield the solution that headquarters wants.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="a-few-notes" class="slide level2">
<h2>A few notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are assuming that all of the costs quoted in this problem cover
opportunity costs.</li>
<li><strong>Vik-Giger can get the optimal choice and remain
decentralized.</strong> They only need to require a transfer price, they
don’t need to centralize the choice of the transfer price.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-upper-end-of-the-range" class="slide level2">
<h2>The upper end of the range:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both Brazil and the US will agree to transfer prices above 700,000,
with the US pushing for higher transfer prices and Brazil pushing for
lower prices.</li>
<li>We don’t know enough to predict what the departments will actually
agree to, though if they use an auction the transfer price will be very
close to the price at which the Swiss drop out.</li>
<li>Brazil will drop out of the bidding at 800,000 so this is the top of
the range.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="slide level2">
<h2>Question 3:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The effective income tax rates for this transaction follow: 40% in
the United States, 60% in Brazil, and 15% in Switzerland. The tax
authorities in the three countries are uncertain about the cost of the
intermediate product and will allow any transfer price between $500,000
and $700,000. If Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries want to maximize
after-tax operating income:
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>should the equipment be manufactured and</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>where and at what price should it be transferred?</li>

<h2>Optimal Transfer Pricing In the Presence of Taxes</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Now the transfer price is no longer being used primarily for
information and incentives.</li>
<li>The transfer price is now used to locate income in low tax
regimes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s consider our two options.</p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2>
