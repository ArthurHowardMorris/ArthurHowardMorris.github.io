# Exam Paper Review:

1. Do not reproduce the exam in any way (physically or electronically).
    - No phones, tablets, laptops, etc.
    - No pens, pencils, notes, notebooks, etc.
2. Do not alter your exam in any way.
    - No pens, pencils, etc.
    - Note that altering your exam in order to get a higher grade will result in a lower grade.
3. At the end of the session today:
    - Return your exam in the box marked __RETURN__.
    - Unless you believe that there was a grading mistake. In this case, talk to Dr. Morris and then place your exam in the box marked __REGRADE__.
    - Note that we must apply the same grading criteria to all students.
