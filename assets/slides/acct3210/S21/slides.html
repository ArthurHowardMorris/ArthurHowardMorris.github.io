<h3>Kiddo Inc Example <!-- from ch 10 --></h3>
<p>Kiddo Incorporated manufactures running shoes. Recently, it added a
new line of pump sneakers. Over the past two years, sales of both the
Runner and the Pump have been flat at 5,000,000 and 2,400,000 pairs,
respectively. However, in anticipation of increased sales, production
was increased from 5,140,000 to 5,200,000 for the Runner and from
3,000,000 to 3,564,000 for the Pump from year 1 to year 2.</p>
</section>
<section id="kiddo-inc-example-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Kiddo Inc Example</h3>
<p>Production costs for the two sneakers are very different. Materials
cost $14.00 per Runner and $17.75 per Pump. Labor costs are $4.60 and
$5.00 and variable overhead costs are $6.60 and $7.30 for the Runner and
the Pump, respectively. Fixed overhead costs are $50 million and are
allocated based on direct labor cost. Kiddo uses LIFO.</p>

<h3>ABC and Decision Making</h3>
<ul>
<li>ABC improves pricing decisions because product costs are presumably
more accurate estimates of opportunity cost. </li>
<li>Low-volume high-complexity products should get higher prices or be
dropped. The benefit here is that this decision will be based on the
actual avoidable costs.</li>

<li>Now, however, most companies already gather much of the needed
information as a part of other systems.</li>
<li>Today, implementing ABC requires management and analysis of data
generated throughout the organization. (ATK example)</li>

<h3>ABC for strategic analysis rather than to replace absorption
costing:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Absorption required for external reporting</li>
<li>ABC for strategic analysis and special studies</li>
<li>ABC is most likely to be adopted by:</li>
<li>Manufacturers in price-sensitive competitive markets</li>
<li>Large plants with many different products and processes</li>

<h3>Cost Allocation and Automation</h3>
<ul>
<li>In highly automated plants where direct labor costs are a small
share of total costs, using machine hours as an activity base gives more
accurate cost than direct labor.</li>
<li>Automation improves efficiency and eliminates bottlenecks so that
less indirect labor is needed for moving, inspecting, and expediting
products.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cost-allocation-as-a-tax-system" class="slide level3">
<h3>Cost Allocation as a Tax System</h3>
<p>(Motivation versus Accuracy)</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost allocations are an internal tax system that motivate mangers to
use less of resources with high cost allocations. (Chapter 7).</li>
<li>Cycle time: Zytec uses total time to manufacture the product as its
allocation base to motivate managers to reduce cycle time. </li>
<li>Direct labor: Hitachi allocates overhead on direct labor hours so
that managers improve automation as a way to eliminate costly direct
labor.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ### How does ABC relate to the cost functions we were writing in the beginning of the course? -->
<!--  cost systems can be related back to the discussion of cost curves in [ Chapter 2. L Chapter 2 presented a linear cost curve of the form -->
<!-- TC = VC × 0 + FC -->
<!-- where -->
<!-- TC = Total cost -->
<!-- VC = Variable cost per unit -->
<!-- 0 = Number of units produced -->
<!-- FC = Fixed cost -->
<!-- That is, total cost, TC, can be disaggregated into variable costs, VC × Q, and fixed cost, FC. Fixed costs, by definition, do not vary with Q, units produced. -->
<!-- Activity-based costing assumes a more complex cost function-namely, -->
<!-- TC = VCx 0 + BC X B + PC XL + OC -->
<!-- where -->
<!-- TC = Total cost -->
<!-- VC = Variable cost ver unit -->
<!-- 0 = Number of units produced -->
<!-- BC = Cost per batch -->
<!-- B = Number of batches -->
<!-- PC = Cost per product line -->
<!-- L = Number of product lines -->
<!-- OC = All other costs that do not vary with some activity measure -->
<!-- In addition. -->
<!-- FC = BC X B+ PCXL + OC -->
<!-- That is, some fixed costs, FC, that do not vary with units produced do vary with the number of batches and product lines. -->
