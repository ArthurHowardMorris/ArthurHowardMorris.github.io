with Activity Based Costing (ABC)</h1>
</section>

<section id="outline-of-our-discussion-of-absorption-costing"
class="slide level3">
<h3>Outline of our discussion of absorption costing:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this lecture we will introduce activity-based costing (ABC) and
compare it to traditional absorption costing.</li>
<li>The last several lectures began the discussion of absorption
costing, and it’s discontents.</li>
<li>We also discussed how changes in performance measurement require
changes in other parts of organizational architecture (performance
measurement and decision rights partitioning).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="problems-with-absorption-costing" class="slide level3">
<h3>Problems with absorption costing:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Allocating fixed costs on a unit basis makes the seem variable.
<ul>
<li>The death spiral</li>
<li>Bad outsourcing choices</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Incentive to overproduce.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="one-more-problem-inaccurate-product-costs"
class="slide level3">
<h3>One more problem: Inaccurate Product Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiple products</strong>, absorption costing often does
not accurately represent the opportunity costs of different
products.</li>
<li>Absorption costing uses few input factors, such as direct labor
hours or machine hours, to allocate overhead costs</li>
<li>Absorption costing does not clearly show how costs are influenced by
the diversity and complexity of production processes.</li>
<li>Absorption cost systems assign too few costs to small batches and
complex special orders.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="abcs-major-features" class="slide level3">
<h3>ABC’s Major Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Better identifies activities that drive costs</li>
<li>Tracks set-up costs associated with each batch and product line</li>
<li>Analyzes activities rather than input resources</li>
<li>Allows cost drivers to vary across the firm.</li>
<li>Cost analysts attempt to identify cause-and-effect cost drivers for
allocating overhead costs.</li>
<li>Reduces overhead cost pools that are allocated with an arbitrary
allocation base</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="classifying-abc-cost-drivers" class="slide level3">
<h3>Classifying ABC Cost Drivers</h3>
<p>Classify cost drivers into one of four categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unit-level</li>
<li>Batch-level</li>
<li>Product-level</li>
<li>Production-sustaining</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="abc-allows-us-to-isolate-costs-from-production-decisions"

<h3>ABC allows us to isolate costs from production decisions</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is core to overproduction, death spirals, and incorrect
outsourcing choices.</li>

</section>
<section id="unit-level-costs" class="slide level3">
<h3>Unit-level Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit-level costs</strong>: activities that are performed at
least once for each unit of product</li>
<li>Total amount of unit-level costs is a linear function of the
quantity produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: - Direct labor and direct material - Machine servicing
related to number of units produced</p>
</section>
<section id="batch-level-costs" class="slide level3">
<h3>Batch-level Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch-level costs</strong>: activities that are performed
once for each batch of products</li>
<li>Batch-level costs are independent of the number of units in the
batch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indirect labor, such as production supervisors</li>
<li>Machine set-ups</li>
<li>Moving batches</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="product-level-costs" class="slide level3">
<h3>Product-level Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product-level costs</strong>: activities that support
production of a product type or model</li>
<li>Product-level costs do not vary with the number of batches
produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering support</li>
<li>Equipment usable for only one product line</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="production-sustaining-costs" class="slide level3">
<h3>Production-sustaining Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Production-sustaining costs:</strong> all remaining
activities required for overall operation of production facility</li>
<li>Production-sustaining costs do not depend on number of units,
batches, or product lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plant security, insurance, general maintenance</li>
<li>Plant accounting and administration</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-abc-vs.-absorption" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example: ABC vs. Absorption</h3>
<ul>
<li>Similarities: Direct and unit-level costs are allocated the
same.</li>
<li>Differences: ABC allocates more indirect costs to products with
smaller production volume and more complex set-up (models 801 and
901).</li>

<h3>ABC and Decision Making</h3>
<ul>
<li>ABC improves pricing decisions because product costs are presumably
more accurate estimates of opportunity cost. </li>
<li>Low-volume high-complexity products should get higher prices or be
dropped.</li>
<li>ABC focuses attention on reducing use of activities that are most
associated with costs.</li>

<h3>ABC and Decision Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>ABC requires more monitoring.</li>
<li>Time to identify and measure activities</li>
<li>Meetings to resolve disputes over activity drivers</li>
<li>ABC shifts decision rights over activity drivers to lower-level
managers with specialized knowledge of the relation between costs and
activities.</li>
<li>Departmental managers could pick cost drivers that maximize their
performance rewards.</li>

<h2>Consider Figure 11-4</h2>

<p>Why is this?</p>
</section>
<section id="abc-measures-costs-not-benefits" class="slide level3">
<h3>ABC Measures Costs, Not Benefits</h3>
<p>ABC does not measure the benefits of producing/selling multiple
products.</p>
<p>Firms offer multiple products because of economies of scale and
scope.</p>
<p>ABC allocates common costs – not the common or joint benefits of
multiple products.</p>
</section>
<section id="history-of-abc" class="slide level3">
<h3>History of ABC</h3>
<p>Pre-cursors of ABC were efforts to improve cost allocations in 19th
century businesses.</p>
<p>(See side-bar examples).</p>
<p>Activity-based costing terminology was invented and popularized in
the late 1980s to early 1990s.</p>
<p>In the later 1990s and up to the present, the success of ABC systems
has been mixed and alternative strategies have been successfully applied
to achieve some of the same benefits of ABC with less cost.</p>
</section>
<section id="abc-cost-accumulation-and-allocation" class="slide level3">
<h3>ABC Cost Accumulation and Allocation</h3>
<p>The bookkeeping for ABC is similar to the two-stage allocation
procedure in </p>
<p>Figure 9-4.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Unit-level costs are directly assigned to products.</p></li>
<li><p>Indirect costs are accumulated in the appropriate activity cost
pools.</p></li>
<li><p>Indirect costs are allocated from the activity cost pools using
the batch, product, and production-sustaining cost drivers.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="acceptance-of-abc" class="slide level3">
<h3>Acceptance of ABC</h3>
<p>Although many controllers are interested in ABC, most are skeptical
that the benefits of ABC outweigh its implementation costs. </p>
<p>ABC for strategic analysis rather than replace absorption
costing:</p>
<p>Absorption required for external reporting</p>
<p>ABC for strategic analysis and special studies</p>
<p>ABC is most likely to be adopted by:</p>
<p>Manufacturers in price-sensitive competitive markets</p>
<p>Large plants with many different products and processes</p>
</section>
<section id="cost-allocation-and-automation" class="slide level3">
<h3>Cost Allocation and Automation</h3>
<p>In highly automated plants where direct labor costs are a small share
of total costs, using machine hours as an activity base gives more
accurate cost than direct labor.</p>
<p>Automation improves efficiency and eliminates bottlenecks so that
less indirect labor is needed for moving, inspecting, and expediting
products.</p>
</section>
<section id="cost-allocation-as-a-tax-system" class="slide level3">
<h3>Cost Allocation as a Tax System</h3>
<p>(Motivation versus Accuracy)</p>
<p>Cost allocations are an internal tax system that motivate mangers to
use less of resources with high cost allocations. (Chapter 7).</p>
<p>Cycle time: Zytec uses total time to manufacture the product as its
allocation base to motivate managers to reduce cycle time. </p>
<p>Direct labor: Hitachi allocates overhead on direct labor hours so
that managers improve automation as a way to eliminate costly direct
labor.</p>
