    "2. Tax rates $t$ vary across individuals, jurisdictions, organizations, and assets.\n",
    "3. pre-tax returns $r$ correspond to post tax returns $r(1-t)$ \n",
    "4. When preferential tax treatment increases demand for a tax favored asset it's price increases. This price change is an _implicit_ tax.\n",
    "5. When tax payers use organizational forms like pensions and insurance policies to avoid taxes it is called _organizational form arbitrage_.\n",
    "6. When high-tax tax payers issue taxable debt to finance the purchase of tax free debt (e.g. municipal bonds in the US) issued by low-tax tax payers (e.g. US non-profit universities) it is called _clientele arbitrage_.\n",
    "7. The depreciation tax shield is the present value of the reduction in tax payments afforded by the depreciation deduction.\n",
    "8. The value of the tax shield $TS$ is a function of the investment $x$, the cash flow it generates $k$, the risk-free rate of return $r$, the tax rate $t$, and the depreciation rate $d$.\n",
    "$$TS=f(x,k,t,d,r)$$\n",
