title: "Class Note: Incentives and Managerial Compensation"

# Overview
 
Managers may be considered _agents_ of the firm’s owners (or _principals_). In
large companies, the principal/agent relationships are hierarchical. A CEO is
employed to manage the firm in the shareholders’ interest. The CEO is thus the
shareholders’ agent. Divisional Managers, in turn, are agents of the CEO, the
Plant Manager is an agent of the Production Division Manager, and so on. Each
link involves a principal and an agent, with the former delegating substantial
authority for making decisions to the latter.

In every principal-agent relation, there may be a _conflict of interest_ between
the principal and the agent. For example, the owner might want the manager to
work hard, and avoid unnecessary expenses, so that the owner’s surplus or
profit may be high. But the manager may not want to work hard to increase the
owner’s surplus. He may choose to use the company’s money to pursue pet
projects and enjoy other perquisites (such as expensive office furniture and
first-class travel).

Such a conflict of interest can often be reduced with an _incentive scheme_,
which aligns the interests of principal and agent. The owner, for instance, can
base a CEO’s compensation on company profit, or she can offer him shares of the
company. The CEO can then choose an incentive scheme for every divisional
manager, based on company profits or performance evaluation of the division
(which may in turn be based on output, costs, divisional profits, ROI, etc.).

This note is about the structure and design of incentive schemes. We will:

- describe the attributes of incentive schemes,
- and discuss the basic principles and issues governing the design of incentive
  schemes.

# Evaluation and incentives: Basic principles 

Consider the manager of a factory. An owner’s return on investment in the
factory depends on many factors. For example, the market price of raw materials
and finished goods, and the number of equipment breakdowns will affect the
factory’s profit and the owner’s return. These factors will cause the
performance of the firm to be uncertain. The owner’s return will also depend to
some extent on how hard-working and/or talented the manager is. If the manager
works hard (i.e., if he can keep the machinery in good condition, react quickly
to breakdowns, treat workers well and maintain discipline, etc.), his effort
will be productive in the sense that it will increase the overall _probability_
of good performance. Outstanding effort on the manager’s part, however, will
not necessarily result in good performance, because factors beyond the
manager’s control (such as external price fluctuations or deficient raw
material supply) may make bad performance inevitable.

In this situation, how should the manager be paid by the owner? One principle,
to which many firms have traditionally adhered, is that the manager should be
responsible only for those dimensions of performance that he can _control_.
Since the firm's good performance cannot be completely guaranteed by the
manager, he should not be held responsible for, nor should his pay depend upon,
factors he cannot control. We refer to this as the _controllability principle_.

Beyond a certain point, Huck does not like to work. If every week Huck put in
just forty hours, did not work too hard during any one of those hours, and took
a reasonable paycheck home every Friday, Huck would be a happy guy. Sadly, Huck
must do some things he finds unpleasant and hard in order to maintain his
standard of living. Huck will not do these things unless he thinks the rewards
outweigh his distaste for those activities.

## Scenario 1: Risk-Aversion

Huck makes widgets in Miss Watson’s factory. The number of widgets produced
depends partly on Huck’s effort and partly on random events. Huck can work
hard, experience bad luck and widget output will be low. Or, Huck could shirk
his duties, but with good luck, widget output is high. Ideally, Huck always
works diligently. On average, if Huck is diligent, widget output is
satisfactory.

### Case 1A:

Assume:
- Miss Watson observes exactly how hard Huck works. 

__Question:__ How should Miss Watson compensate Huck?

Consider:
- a salary;
- a bonus based on the effort Huck exerts;
- a bonus based on the number of widgets produced.

### Case 1B: 

#### Assume:
1. Miss Watson does not know exactly what Huck does.
2. She can make inferences about Huck’s effort from widget output.
3. Huck is risk-neutral.


#### __Question:__ How should Miss Watson compensate Huck?

#### Consider:
- a salary;
- a bonus based on the number of widgets produced. 

What does it mean if the bonus per widget is equal to the selling price of
widgets and the salary is negative? 

Can you give a realistic example that corresponds closely to Case 1B and the
“salary” is negative?

### Case 1C:

#### Assume:
1. Huck is risk averse.[^rn]
2. Miss Watson does not know exactly what Huck does.

[^rn]: Informal interpretation of risk aversion: Holding the expected amount of
  pay constant, Huck dislikes pay plans that have higher variances. But, Huck
  may prefer a high variance/high mean pay plan to a low variance/low mean pay
  plan, depending on just how risk averse he is.

#### __Question:__ How should Miss Watson Compensate Huck?

#### Consider:

- a salary;
- a bonus based on the number of widgets produced.

Consider how output and associated risks are shared between Miss Watson and
Huck in each of these examples. Do pay plans exist that make Miss Watson and
Huck both better off than others? What is the source of such improvements in
Miss Watson’s and Huck’s welfare?

## Scenario 2: Controllability/Informativeness

#### Assume:

1. Huck is risk-averse.
2. Miss Watson does not know exactly what Huck does.
3. In addition to the number of widgets produced, Miss Watson has some other
   data that is informative of Huck’s effort. One interpretation of this other
   information could be that it is an accounting report.

#### __Question:__ How should Miss Watson compensate Huck?

#### Consider:
- a salary;
- a bonus based on the number of widgets produced;
- a bonus based on the accounting information;
- a bonus based on the price of tea in China.

In and of itself, the accounting report has no value to either Miss Watson or
Huck. It cannot be sold for cash as widgets are, but it permits better
contracts to be written between Huck and Miss Watson. Would Miss Watson pay
some money to acquire such a report? Would Huck?

# Conclusions

__General result:__ Whenever signals are informative of Huck’s actions, the
joint surplus available to Huck and Miss Watson can be increased by modifying
the contract to incorporate these components.

__Observation 1:__ If the firm’s performance does not depend at all on the
manager’s action, he should be paid a fixed salary.

__Observation 2:__ If the firm’s performance depends upon the manager’s
actions, and if these actions can be monitored perfectly by the principal, the
incentive problem can be solved perfectly.

__Observation 3:__ If the firm’s performance depends upon manager’s action, and
this action is not directly observable by the principal, then the manager must
be held responsible for observable measures of performance. This is because the
performance variable permits the principal to partly infer the manager’s
action. Making compensation depend on performance influences the manager’s
action in a mutually desirable way.

__Observation 4 :__ If the firm’s performance depends upon the manager’s
action, and this action is not directly observable by the principal, the
manager may end up with a low rather than a high bonus, even if he chooses the
action that the principal wants. That is, he may be held responsible for
factors outside his control.

- Thus, the _controllability principle_ need not be valid in all situations. To
  see another illustration of this, consider whether the manager ought to be
  evaluated on the basis of the performance of other firms in a similar
  situation.


__Observation 5 :__ Relative performance evaluation —Consider several firms
operating in the same industry. In such cases, we often find a significant
correlation between the performances of the different firms that is due to the
commonality of the non-controllable factors (like market fluctuations in input
and output prices). At times, the correlation with a given competitor might be
particularly high; e.g., the other firm might purchase its raw material from
the same source. In this case, the principal will often find it advantageous to
base the salary of the manager not only on the performance of her own firm, but
also on the performance of the other firms (which is completely beyond the
manager’s control).

Incentive schemes for managers base pay on the performance of the firm (or
division or plant) to which they are assigned. Since performance depends on a
large number of variables beyond managers’ control, these managers may end up
bearing a lot of risk.

In other situations—where the firm’s performance is totally independent of
their actions, or where their actions can be directly observed by the
principal—there is no need to impose so much responsibility on managers.
Because the principal can usually absorb risk more easily than managers, it is
more efficient to offer managers a fixed salary (and fire the manager if he
deviates at all from the course of action expected by the principal).

Basing pay on the firm’s performance is sensible only if this performance is
influenced by the manager’s actions, and these actions are not directly
observed by the principal. Then the manager must be induced indirectly to
choose desirable actions: this is achieved by basing the manager’s pay on
whatever variables permit some inference about the manager’s actions. While
this may impose risk on the managers, some risk/responsibility is necessary to
provide managers with appropriate incentives to work hard. In these situations,
the manager may be evaluated on the basis of variables beyond his control.

#### __Question:__ How were you evaluated in your last employment?
- Actual$_{t}$ to Actual$_{t−1}$
- Actual$_{t}$ to Budget$_{t}$
- Actual$_{t}$  to Standard$_{t}$

# Responsibility Accounting 

To implement incentive schemes, organizational performance must be decomposed
into components that reflect, as nearly as possible, individual contributions.
Responsibility accounting is a system of accounting that recognizes various
responsibility centers throughout the organization. Such an accounting system
reflects the plans and actions of each of these centers by allocating
particular revenues and costs to those having the pertinent responsibilities
(also called profitability accounting and activity accounting). 

#### The most common types of responsibility centers are:

- Cost center:
- Profit center:
- Revenue center:
- Investment center:

#### Desirable features of responsibility accounting
- strong link between performance and compensation
- clear distinction between controllable versus non-controllable budget items
- timeliness
- cost effectiveness
