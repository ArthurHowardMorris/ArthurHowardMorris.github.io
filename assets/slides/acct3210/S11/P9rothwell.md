Rothwell Inc. is the leader in computer-integrated manufacturing and factory
automation products and services. The Rothwell product offering is segmented
into 15 product categories, based on product function and primary manufacturing
location.

Rothwell's sales division sells all 15 product categories and is composed of 25
district offices located throughout the United States. The company is highly
decentralized, with district offices responsible for setting sales price,
product mix, and other variables.

District offices are rewarded based on sales. Some large customers have plants
in more than one of Rothwell's sales districts. In cases where sales are made
to these customers, the district offices participate jointly and sales credits
are shared by each district involved.

The sales division compensation plan designed by L. L. Rothwell, founder of the
firm, was structured so that the staff would pursue sales in each of the 15
product categories. The selling program has the following features:

- Each sales representative receives a commission based on a percentage of the
  sales revenue generated. 
- Each district (approximately 160 sales reps) is assigned a quota for each
  product line, defined in terms of dollar sales. 
- In addition to commission, sales reps are eligible for an annual bonus. The
  company calculates individual bonuses by multiplying the number of bonus
  points earned by the individual target bonus amount. Points are credited at
  the district level.
- In order for all sales reps in a district to qualify for a bonus, the
  district must achieve 50 percent of quota in all 15 product groups and 85
  percent of quota in at least 13 groups.
- Bonus points are awarded for sales greater than 85 percent of quota. Five
  product groups have been identified as strategic to Rothwell. These
  "pride-level" products are weighted more heavily in bonus point calculations.

Over the past three years, Rothwell generated exceptionally high sales-and
awarded record bonuses. Profits, however, were lackluster. L. L. was befuddled!
