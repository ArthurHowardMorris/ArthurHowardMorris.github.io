-  Lecture 3: clarify the ols assumptions slide and show how plotting an dthinking through the function solves most of the issues. also do something from regression and other stories about statistical significance.
- Lecture 4: make the implications of the marginal cost slides more clear, also help the student understand thw  dynamics more intuatively (this shoudl prob be a plotting exercise) the marginal product of labor may be helpful.
- Lecture five: the derivation of the min(g0,g1) function is not clear. why can t we sub for cost? in the cost function

- pitch the first portion of the course as a "tools and techniques" session this is when we actually learn how to do the things we claimed we could do after accounting 2200
- then capital budgets, taxes and agency are decisions and the incentives that shape them.
- then this gives us context for thinking more about why variences might occur.
- write a tools section that covers
1. how to get a funtion our of data
2. how to get a function out of a production plan
3. how to validate the production plan with the data.
4. how to optimize what can be chosen 
5. how to predict the future and choose between different futures
- all while making them love python.


It seems like costing systems should come before transfer pricing and that taxes can wait?

## Add this to the syl:

- Excel or Python is essential to the course. If you are comfortable with one, try the other. Use this course to develop your abilities.
- I am passionate about this aspect of the course, but this is also the direction that the accounting profession is moving. The approach I am taking with this course is implementing the direction of the HKUST SBM Accounting Advisory Board.

> "Finally, I would like to note that the increased emphasis of data analytics in our UG program reflects the feedback from our accounting advisory board members -- the accounting education should go beyond training our students to take CPA exams and incorporate more data analytics and soft skill training.  As our board members are leaders of major current and potential employers of our graduates, the department has been working hard to design our course offering to meet the changing business needs. I believe that it will do students a disservice to offer advanced managerial accounting in an “old way” without excel or Python."
