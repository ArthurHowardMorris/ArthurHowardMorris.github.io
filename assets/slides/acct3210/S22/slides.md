### Budgets and Organizational Architecture

- A budget is management’s forecast of revenues, expenses, or profits in a
  future time period.
- Budgets are plans not aspirations.
- Deviations, even income-increasing ones, are not innocuous.

### Budgets and Organizational Architecture

- Knowledge: Budgets communicate key planning assumptions such as product
  prices, units sales, and input prices.
- Partition Decision Rights:  Budget sets guidelines on resources available for
  each segment.
- Performance Evaluation: Responsibility center’s actual performance is
  compared to budget.

### Variances:

- [A statistic that describes the differences between the observations and the
  predictions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)
- A managerial accounting term: the difference between the budgeted and actual
  amount.
- Related, but distinct. Managerial accounting variances are more closely
  related to 'errors' in statistics.


### Variances:

- Variances are termed 'favorable' and 'unfavorable' based on their impact on
  income.
- Keep in mind that budgets are plans, so any variance is evidence that things
  did not go according to plan.

### Variances:

- Favorable (F) variance:  actual revenue > budgeted revenue actual expense <
  budgeted expense
- Unfavorable (U) variance: actual revenue < budgeted revenue actual expense >
  budgeted expense


### Example: Country Club

- Responsibility Centers: 1 profit center and 2 cost centers
- Measurement: Monthly reports compare actual revenues and expenses to budget.
- Budget process separates decision rights. 
  - Initiation and implementation by professional managers.
  - Ratification and monitoring by Board of Directors and members.

### Example: Private University

__Responsibility centers in 4 colleges: 2 cost centers, 2 profit centers.__

- Knowledge: 
  - Number of students drives revenue forecasts.
  - Faculty market drives faculty salary expense.

- Decision rights:    
  - Lower levels prepare initial budgets.
  - Higher levels review and ratify budget.
  - _This process passes knowledge up the organization._ 
  
- Agency problems:  
  - Empire building: request “too large” a budget.
  - Externalities: Cost centers are more likely to add unprofitable programs
    than profit centers.

_Is Auxiliary Services a responsibility center? How should it be evaluated?_


### Example: Large Corporation

- Responsibility centers:
  - 2 cost  (manufacturing and marketing)
  - 1 profit (paper and toner supplies)

- Knowledge:  
  - Vertical transfers (lower to higher levels)
  - Horizontal transfers (marketing to manufacturing)
  - Identify potential bottlenecks in production
  - Identify financing needs

- Contracting: 
  - Budgets are internal contracts between operating segments
  - Divisional managers negotiate budgets
  - Executive managers negotiate disputes and review budgets for consistency
    with corporate strategy


### Trade-off: Communication vs. Evaluation

- Budgets are used for both decision management and decision control.
- Optimal decision making requires managers fully reveal private knowledge
  about production and market conditions during   budget negotiations.
- When budgets are also used for performance evaluation, managers have an
  incentive to make biased budget forecasts so that their actual performance
  will look good relative to budget.

### Budget Ratcheting

- Ratchet effect: Basing next year’s standard of performance on this year’s actual performance.
- Disadvantages:
  - Performance targets usually adjusted upward
  - Employees reduce output to avoid being held to higher standards in the future

- Possible Solution:
  - Eliminate budget targets
  - Estimate next year’s sales
  - More frequent job rotation

- Summary: While the ratchet effect creates dysfunctional behavior, the
  alternatives might produce even greater problems.


### Trade-off: Bottom-up vs. Top-down

- Top-down budgets:
  - Knowledge: Top management can make accurate aggregate forecasts
  - Decision rights: Begin with aggregate forecasts for firm, and then disaggregate down to lower levels
  - Decision control more important than decision management

### Trade-off: Bottom-up vs. Top-down

- Bottom-up budgets (participative budgeting):
  - Knowledge: Lower levels have more knowledge than top
  - Decision rights: Person being held responsible for meeting the target makes the initial budget forecast
  - Decision management more important than decision control


### Modern Approaches to Budgeting

- Building the budget in two distinct steps
  - Step 1:  Construct budgets in operational terms (Lowest levels of the
    organization)
  - Step 2:  Developing a financial plan based on the operational plans from
    Step 1.

### Modern Approaches to Budgeting

- Constructing budgets for financial planning (decision management), but not
  using budgets as performance targets (decision control)
- Units are judged by comparing their actual performance with the actual
  performance of defined “peer units”.
- Actual rewards can include consideration of both financial and non-financial
  performance measures.


### Discuss the Following Assertions

- No simple “one-size-fits-all” panacea exists for resolving the conflict
  between decision management versus decision control when it comes to
  budgeting.
  
- Nor is such a solution ever likely to be found. 


### Trade-off: Resolving Disagreements

- Top executive officers of firms have final decision rights over the entire budget process.
- Top executives resolve disputes among lower levels.
- After adoption, the budget is an informal set of contracts among the various units of the firm.


### Short-run vs. Long-run

- Firms that use only short-term (annual) budgets do not create adequate
  incentives for long-term maintenance and responding to new opportunities.
- Strategic planning requires long-term budgets (2, 5, or 10 years).
- Financial lending institutions often require cash flow projections for the
  length of any proposed borrowing.
- Many firms require managers to prepare both short-term and long-term budgets
  as part of the periodic budget review.

### Line-Item Budgets

- Line-item budgets authorize managers to spend only up to the specified amount on each line item.
- Advantages:
  - Tight control reduces opportunities for managers to take actions inconsistent with firm goals

- Disadvantages:
  - Inflexible in responding to unanticipated needs
  - Little incentive for cost savings


### Facilitating Rolling Budgets

- Cisco uses an 18-month rolling budget versus a static budget.  

- Advantages:
  - Keeps budget more current in a changing environment
  - Managers may react in a more timely manner by better integrating planning and execution.

- Disadvantages:
  - Costs of software and management time
  - Key Solution:  Use a single standardized web page for data entry and
    automatic roll up to the company-wide budget.


### Budget Lapsing

__Budget lapsing is a requirement that funds allocated for a particular year
cannot be carried over to the following year.__

- Advantages:
  - Tighter control than budgets that do not lapse
  - Prevents risk-averse managers from accumulating funds

- Disadvantages:
  - Encourages wasteful spending near end of fiscal year


### Static Budgets

- Do not vary with volume, such as costs that should be fixed
- Volume changes may create budget variances
- Since managers are not insulated from volume changes, they have incentives to
  mitigate impact of adverse volume changes

### Flexible Budgets

- Do adjust for changes in volume, such as semivariable costs that include a
  fixed and variable component
- Evaluate performance after adjusting for volume effects
- Manager is not held responsible for volume changes

<!-- ### Example: GAMESS Inc. -->
<!-- TODO: this is an embarassingly out of date version of the book. -->
<!-- GAMESS Inc. develops, markets, packages, and distributes multimedia computer games. GAMES has outsourced production because it does not believe it can manufacture the games competitively. Its most recent development is an interactive adventure game. Because its multimedia games are different from other computer games in both the physical size of the package and price, GAMESS established a new profit center for the adventure game and future Blu-ray computer games. -->
<!-- GAMESS is in the process of selecting the profit-maximizing price for the new adventure game. Management estimates demand for the new game at various wholesale prices. The retail stores then set the retail price of the same sold to the public. Estimated demand is shown in L Table I. -->

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Sandy Cove is a new small commercial bank in Sandy Cove, Michigan.
- The bank limits interest rate risk by matching the maturity of its assets to
  the maturity of its liabilities.
- By maintaining a spread between interest rates charged and interest rates
  paid, the bank plans to earn a small income.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Management establishes a flexible budget based on interest rates for each
  department.
- The Boat and Car Loan Department offers five-year loans.
- It matches certificates of deposit (CDs) against car and boat loans.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Given all the uncertainty about interest rates, management believes that
  five-year savings interest rates could vary between 2 percent and 16 percent
  for the coming year. (_Note: 'Given' in this sentence embeds a critical
  management accounting activity: forecasting._)
- The savings rate is the rate paid on CD savings accounts.
- The loan rate is the rate charged on auto and boat loans. 

### Sandy Cove Bank

- Expected new demand for fixed-rate, five-vear loans and the new supply of
  fixed-rate, five-year savings accounts at various interest rates.

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand  | Savings Rate | Savings Supply |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 6%        | \$12,100,000 | 2            | \$ 4,700,000%  |
| 7%        | 10,000,000   | 3            | 5,420,000      |
| 8%        | 8,070,000    | 4            | 8,630,000      |
| 9%        | 6,030,000    | 5            | 9,830,000      |
| 10%       | 4,420,000    | 6            | 11,800,000     |

- There are no loans from previous years. Note that the department maintains a
  4 percent spread between loan and savings rates to cover processing, loan
  default, and overhead.

### Sandy Cove Bank

- The amount of new loans granted is always the lesser of the loan demand and
  loan supply.
- For simplicity, this bank may lend 100 percent of deposits.
- Although rates are set nationally, the bank may pay or charge slightly
  different rates to limit demand or boost supply as needed in its local
  market.
- The Boat and Car Loan Department incurs processing, loan default, and
  overhead expenses related to these accounts.
- The first two expenses vary, depending on the dollar amount of the accounts.
- The annual processing expense is budgeted to be 1.5 percent of the loan
  accounts. 
- Default expense is budgeted at 1 percent of the amount loaned per year.
- Again, loans and savings would ideally be the same.
- Overhead expenses are estimated to be \$30,000 for the year, regardless of the
  amount loaned.

### SCB Question 1

1. Calculate the processing, loan default, and overhead expenses for each possible interest rate.

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  |
| 7%        | 10          | 3%           | 5.42           | 5.42      |
| 8%        | 8.07        | 4%           | 8.63           | 8.07      |
| 9%        | 6.03        | 5%           | 9.83           | 6.03      |
| 10%       | 4.42        | 6%           | 11.8           | 4.42      |


### SCB Solution 1


| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans | Processing Expenses |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  | \$70,500            |
| 7%        | 10          | 3%           | 5.42           | 5.42      | 81,300              |
| 8%        | 8.07        | 4%           | 8.63           | 8.07      | 121,050             |
| 9%        | 6.03        | 5%           | 9.83           | 6.03      | 90,450              |
| 10%       | 4.42        | 6%           | 11.8           | 4.42      | 66,300              |

- Processing is 1.5% of loan accounts

### SCB Solution 1

| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans | Processing Expenses | Default Exp |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  | \$70,500            | \$47,000    |

- Default expense is budgeted at 1 percent of the amount loaned per year.

### SCB Solution 1


| Loan Rate | Loan Demand | Savings Rate | Savings Supply | New Loans | Processing Expenses | Default Exp | Overhead Expenses |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 6%        | \$12.1 M    | 2%           | \$ 4.7 M       | \$ 4.7 M  | \$70,500            | \$47,000    | \$30,000          |

- These are the budgeted expenses, this is the foundation of financing plans to make sure that these resources are inplace when they are needed.

### SCB Question 2

2. Create an annual budgeted income statement for five-year loans and deposits for the Boat and Car Loan Department given a savings interest rate of 4 percent. Remember to match supply and demand.

|                     |                   |           |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Interest income     | \$8,070,000 × 8%= | \$645,600 |
| Interest expense    | \$8,070,000 × 4%= | 322,800   |
| Net interest income |                   | \$322,800 |
| Fixed overhead      |                   | 30,000    |
| Processing expense  |                   | 121,050   |
| Default expense     |                   | 80,700    |
| Net income          |                   | \$ 91,050 |

### SCB Question 3

3. Table 2 shows the actual income statement for the Boat and Car Loan Department. Included are the actual loans and savings for the same period. Calculate the variances and provide a possible explanation.

|                     | Budget    | Actual      |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Interest income     | \$645,600 | \$ 645,766  |
| Interest expense    | 322,800   | 314,360     |
| Net interest income | \$322,800 | \$ 331,406  |
| Fixed overhead      | 30,000    | 30,200      |
| Processing expense  | 121,050   | 130,522     |
| Default expense     | 80,700    | 77,800      |
| Net income          | \$ 91,050 | \$ 92,884   |
| Loans               | 8,070,000 | \$8,062,000 |
| Deposits            | 8,070,000 | \$8,123,000 |

### SCB Solution 3

|                     | Budget    | Actual      | Fav. (Unfav.) Variance |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Interest income     | \$645,600 | \$ 645,766  | \$ 166                 |
| Interest expense    | 322,800   | 314,360     | 8,440                  |
| Net interest income | \$322,800 | \$ 331,406  | \$ 8,606               |
| Fixed overhead      | 30,000    | 30,200      | (200)                  |
| Processing expense  | 121,050   | 130,522     | (9,472)                |
| Default expense     | 80,700    | 77,800      | 2,900                  |
| Net income          | \$ 91,050 | \$ 92,884   | 1,834                  |
| Loans               | 8,070,000 | \$8,062,000 | \$ (8,000)             |
| Deposits            | 8,070,000 | \$8,123,000 | \$(53,000)             |

### SCB Solution 3

- Even though loans were lower and deposits were higher than expected, interest
  income was higher and interest expense was lower than expected.
- The answer can be obtained by calculating the average interest rates earned
  and paid.
- On \$8,062,000 worth of loans, Sandy Cove earned \$645,766 interest, or 8.01
  percent (0.01 percent more than expected).
- Similarly, it paid only 3.87 percent (0.13 percent less) on deposits.
- Therefore, the net interest income variance of \$8,606 is a combination of
  two effects: the variance in the actual loans and deposits (quantity) and the
  variance in the interest rates (price).
- The combined effects are a favorable interest income variance, a favorable
  interest expense variance, and an overall favorable net interest income
  variance.
- At a savings interest rate of 4 percent, there is an excess supply of
  deposits over demand for loans.
- The Boat and Car Loan Department lowered the interest rate on deposits to
  stem additional deposits.
- The increase in the interest rate on loans can be attributed only to an
  increase in the demand for loans, which resulted in the department charging a
  slightly higher average interest rate.
- The higher processing expense could be related to the higher number of
  accounts processed and improvements in the default rate.
- That is, the favorable default expense could be attributed to an improved
  screening process-related to spending more on processing.

### Incremental vs. Zero-Based Budgets

- __Incremental budgeting:__
  - Begin with current year’s core budget and make incremental changes
  - Review focuses on incremental changes and may ignore inefficiencies in core
    budget

- __Zero-based budgeting (ZBB):__
  - Mandates each line item in total must be justified each year
  - Motivates managers to eliminate inefficient expenses
  - Useful when firm is changing strategic direction
  - Becomes less useful when same justifications are used each year

### Appendix: Master Budget Example

__Study Figure 6-3.__
<!-- TODO: put the figure here -->

- Logical relationships
  - Sales budget drives production and purchasing
  - Production drives materials and labor budget
  - Production and sales drive inventory and cost of goods sold

- Master budget statements
  - Budgeted income statement
  - Budgeted balance sheet
  - Budgeted cash flows


### Budgets and Economic Darwinism

- Budgets may result in suboptimal performance because:
  - Too much emphasis on financial rather than nonfinancial measures
  - Short-term rather long-term results
  - Maximizing incentive bonuses for manager rather than firm value
  - Too much time analyzing budget variances

- Despite all these problems, budgets persist in firms.

- The economic Darwinism principle implies budgeting must be yielding benefits
  at least as large as their costs.
