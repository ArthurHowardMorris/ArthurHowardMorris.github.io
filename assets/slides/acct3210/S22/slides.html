<h3>Budgets and Organizational Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>A budget is management’s forecast of revenues, expenses, or profits
in a future time period.</li>
<li>Budgets are plans not aspirations.</li>
<li>Deviations, even income-increasing ones, are not innocuous.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="budgets-and-organizational-architecture-1"
class="slide level3">
<h3>Budgets and Organizational Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge: Budgets communicate key planning assumptions such as
product prices, units sales, and input prices.</li>
<li>Partition Decision Rights: Budget sets guidelines on resources
available for each segment.</li>
<li>Performance Evaluation: Responsibility center’s actual performance
is compared to budget.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="variances" class="slide level3">
<h3>Variances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In statistics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">A
measure of the differences between the observations and the
predictions.</a></li>
<li>In managerial accounting: The difference between the budgeted and
actual amounts.</li>
<li>Related, but distinct. Managerial accounting variances are more
closely related to ‘errors’ in statistics, this makes sense as they are
errors in prediction.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="variances-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Variances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Variances are termed ‘favorable’ and ‘unfavorable’ based on their
impact on income.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that budgets are plans, so any variance is evidence
that things did not go according to plan.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="variances-2" class="slide level3">
<h3>Variances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Favorable (F) variance: actual revenue &gt; budgeted revenue actual
expense &lt; budgeted expense</li>
<li>Unfavorable (U) variance: actual revenue &lt; budgeted revenue
actual expense &gt; budgeted expense</li>

class="slide level3">
<h3>Trade-off: Communication vs. Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Budgets are used for both decision management and decision
control.</li>
<li>Optimal decision making requires managers fully reveal private
knowledge about production and market conditions during budget
negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="trade-off-communication-vs.-evaluation-1"
class="slide level3">
<h3>Trade-off: Communication vs. Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
<li>When budgets are also used for performance evaluation, managers have
an incentive to make biased budget forecasts so that their actual
performance will look good relative to budget.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="budget-ratcheting" class="slide level3">
<h3>Budget Ratcheting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ratchet effect: Basing next year’s standard of performance on this
year’s actual performance.</li>
<li>Disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>Performance targets usually adjusted upward</li>
<li>Employees reduce output to avoid being held to higher standards in
the future</li>

</section>
<section id="budget-ratcheting-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Budget Ratcheting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Possible Solution:

<h3>Modern Approaches to Budgeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Building the budget in two distinct steps
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Construct budgets in operational terms (Lowest levels of the
organization)</li>
<li>Step 2: Developing a financial plan based on the operational plans
from Step 1.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="modern-approaches-to-budgeting-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Modern Approaches to Budgeting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Constructing budgets for financial planning (decision management),
but not using budgets as performance targets (decision control)</li>
<li>Units are judged by comparing their actual performance with the
actual performance of defined “peer units”.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="modern-approaches-to-budgeting-2" class="slide level3">
<h3>Modern Approaches to Budgeting</h3>
<ul>

<h3>What do you think of the Following Assertions?</h3>
<ul>
<li>No simple “one-size-fits-all” panacea exists for resolving the

<h3>Short-run vs. Long-run</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firms that use only short-term (annual) budgets do not create
adequate incentives for long-term maintenance and responding to new
opportunities.</li>
<li>Strategic planning requires long-term budgets (2, 5, or 10
years).</li>
<li>Financial lending institutions often require cash flow projections
for the length of any proposed borrowing.</li>
<li>Many firms require managers to prepare both short-term and long-term
budgets as part of the periodic budget review.</li>

<h3>Line-Item Budgets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Line-item budgets authorize managers to spend only up to the

<li>Tight control reduces opportunities for managers to take actions
inconsistent with firm goals</li>

<h3>Incremental vs. Zero-Based Budgets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incremental budgeting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Begin with current year’s core budget and make incremental
changes</li>
<li>Review focuses on incremental changes and may ignore inefficiencies
in core budget</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Zero-based budgeting (ZBB):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mandates each line item in total must be justified each year</li>
<li>Motivates managers to eliminate inefficient expenses</li>
<li>Useful when firm is changing strategic direction</li>
<li>Becomes less useful when same justifications are used each year</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="static-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Static Budgets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not vary with volume, such as costs that should be fixed</li>
<li>Volume changes may create budget variances</li>
<li>Since managers are not insulated from volume changes, they have
incentives to mitigate impact of adverse volume changes</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="flexible-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Flexible Budgets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do adjust for changes in volume, such as semivariable costs that
include a fixed and variable component</li>
<li>Evaluate performance after adjusting for volume effects</li>
<li>Manager is not held responsible for volume changes</li>

decompose variances!</p>
<!-- ### Example: GAMESS Inc. -->
<!-- TODO: this is an embarassingly out of date version of the book. -->
<!-- GAMESS Inc. develops, markets, packages, and distributes multimedia computer games. GAMES has outsourced production because it does not believe it can manufacture the games competitively. Its most recent development is an interactive adventure game. Because its multimedia games are different from other computer games in both the physical size of the package and price, GAMESS established a new profit center for the adventure game and future Blu-ray computer games. -->
<!-- GAMESS is in the process of selecting the profit-maximizing price for the new adventure game. Management estimates demand for the new game at various wholesale prices. The retail stores then set the retail price of the same sold to the public. Estimated demand is shown in L Table I. -->

<h3>SCB Solution 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even though loans were lower and deposits were higher than expected,

<h3>SCB Solution 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>On $8,062,000 worth of loans, Sandy Cove earned $645,766 interest,
or 8.01 percent (0.01 percent more than expected).</li>
<li>Similarly, it paid only 3.87 percent (0.13 percent less) on

</ul>
</section>
<section id="scb-solution-3-3" class="slide level3">
<h3>SCB Solution 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, the net interest income variance of $8,606 is a
combination of two effects: the variance in the actual loans and
deposits (quantity) and the variance in the interest rates (price).</li>
<li>The combined effects are a favorable interest income variance, a
favorable interest expense variance, and an overall favorable net
interest income variance.</li>

<h3>SCB Solution 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>At a savings interest rate of 4 percent, there is an excess supply
of deposits over demand for loans.</li>
<li>The Boat and Car Loan Department lowered the interest rate on
deposits to stem additional deposits.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="scb-solution-3-5" class="slide level3">
<h3>SCB Solution 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>The increase in the interest rate on loans can be attributed only to
an increase in the demand for loans, which resulted in the department
charging a slightly higher average interest rate.</li>
<li>The higher processing expense could be related to the higher number
of accounts processed and improvements in the default rate.</li>
<li>That is, the favorable default expense could be attributed to an
improved screening process-related to spending more on processing.</li>
