class="slide level3">
<h3>Budgets and Organizational Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>A budget is management’s forecast of revenues, expenses, or profits
in a future time period.</li>
<li>Knowledge: Budgets communicate key planning assumptions such as
product prices, units sales, and input prices.</li>
<li>Partition Decision Rights: Budget sets guidelines on resources
available for each segment.</li>
<li>Performance Evaluation: Responsibility center’s actual performance
is compared to budget.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="variances" class="slide level3">
<h3>Variances:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">A statistic that
describes the differences between the observations and the
predictions.</a></li>
<li>A managerial accounting term: the difference between the budgeted
and actual amount.</li>
<li>Related, but distinct. Managerial accounting variances are more
closely related to ‘errors’ in statistics.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="variances-1" class="slide level3">
<h3>Variances:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Variances are termed ‘favorable’ and ‘unfavorable’ based on their
impact on income.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that budgets are plans, so any variance is evidence
that things did not go according to plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Favorable (F) variance: actual revenue &gt; budgeted revenue
actual expense &lt; budgeted expense</p></li>
<li><p>Unfavorable (U) variance: actual revenue &lt; budgeted revenue
actual expense &gt; budgeted expense</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-country-club" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example: Country Club</h3>
<ul>
<li>Responsibility Centers: 1 profit center and 2 cost centers</li>
<li>Measurement: Monthly reports compare actual revenues and expenses to
budget.</li>
<li>Budget process separates decision rights. Initiation and
implementation by professional managers. Ratification and monitoring by
Board of Directors and members.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-private-university" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example: Private University</h3>
<p>Responsibility centers in 4 colleges: 2 cost centers, 2 profit
centers. Knowledge: Number of students drives revenue forecasts. Faculty
market drives faculty salary expense. Decision rights:<br />
Lower levels prepare initial budgets. Higher levels review and ratify
budget. Agency problems:<br />
Empire building: request “too large” a budget. Externalities: Cost
centers are more likely to add unprofitable programs than profit
centers.</p>
<p>Is Auxiliary Services a responsibility center? How should it be
evaluated?</p>
</section>
<section id="example-large-corporation" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example: Large Corporation</h3>
<p>Responsibility centers: 2 cost (manufacturing and marketing) 1 profit
(paper and toner supplies)</p>
<p>Knowledge:<br />
Vertical transfers (lower to higher levels) Horizontal transfers
(marketing to manufacturing) Identify potential bottlenecks in
production Identify financing needs</p>
<p>Contracting: Budgets are internal contracts between operating
segments Divisional managers negotiate budgets Executive managers
negotiate disputes and review budgets for consistency with corporate
strategy</p>
</section>
<section id="trade-off-communication-vs.-evaluation"
class="slide level3">
<h3>Trade-off: Communication vs. Evaluation</h3>
<p>Budgets are used for both decision management and decision
control.</p>
<p>Optimal decision making requires managers fully reveal private
knowledge about production and market conditions during budget
negotiations.</p>
<p>When budgets are also used for performance evaluation, managers have
an incentive to make biased budget forecasts so that their actual
performance will look good relative to budget.</p>
</section>
<section id="budget-ratcheting" class="slide level3">
<h3>Budget Ratcheting</h3>
<p>Ratchet effect: Basing next year’s standard of performance on this
year’s actual performance.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Performance targets usually adjusted upward Employees
reduce output to avoid being held to higher standards in the future</p>
<p>Possible Solution: Eliminate budget targets Estimate next year’s
sales More frequent job rotation</p>
<p>Summary: While the ratchet effect creates dysfunctional behavior, the
alternatives might produce even greater problems.</p>
</section>
<section id="trade-off-bottom-up-vs.-top-down" class="slide level3">
<h3>Trade-off: Bottom-up vs. Top-down</h3>
<p>Top-down budgets: Knowledge: Top management can make accurate
aggregate forecasts Decision rights: Begin with aggregate forecasts for
firm, and then disaggregate down to lower levels Decision control more
important than decision management</p>
<p>Bottom-up budgets (participative budgeting): Knowledge: Lower levels
have more knowledge than top Decision rights: Person being held
responsible for meeting the target makes the initial budget forecast
Decision management more important than decision control</p>
</section>
<section id="new-approaches-to-budgeting" class="slide level3">
<h3>New Approaches to Budgeting</h3>
<p>Building the budget in two distinct steps Step 1: Construct budgets
in operational terms (Lowest levels of the organization) Step 2:
Developing a financial plan based on the operational plans from Step
1.</p>
<p>Constructing budgets for financial planning (decision management),
but not using budgets as performance targets (decision control) Units
are judged by comparing their actual performance with the actual
performance of defined “peer units”. Actual rewards can include
consideration of both financial and non-financial performance
measures.</p>
</section>
<section id="discuss-the-following-assertions" class="slide level3">
<h3>Discuss the Following Assertions</h3>
<p>No simple “one-size-fits-all” panacea exists for resolving the
conflict between decision management versus decision control when it
comes to budgeting.</p>
<p>Nor is such a solution ever likely to be found.</p>
</section>
<section id="trade-off-resolving-disagreements" class="slide level3">
<h3>Trade-off: Resolving Disagreements</h3>
<p>Top executive officers of firms have final decision rights over the
entire budget process.</p>
<p>Top executives resolve disputes among lower levels.</p>
<p>After adoption, the budget is an informal set of contracts among the
various units of the firm.</p>
</section>
<section id="short-run-vs.-long-run" class="slide level3">
<h3>Short-run vs. Long-run</h3>
<p>Firms that use only short-term (annual) budgets do not create
adequate incentives for long-term maintenance and responding to new
opportunities.</p>
<p>Strategic planning requires long-term budgets (2, 5, or 10
years).</p>
<p>Financial lending institutions often require cash flow projections
for the length of any proposed borrowing.</p>
<p>Many firms require managers to prepare both short-term and long-term
budgets as part of the periodic budget review.</p>
</section>
<section id="line-item-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Line-Item Budgets</h3>
<p>Line-item budgets authorize managers to spend only up to the
specified amount on each line item.</p>
<p>Advantages: Tight control reduces opportunities for managers to take
actions inconsistent with firm goals</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Inflexible in responding to unanticipated needs Little
incentive for cost savings</p>
</section>
<section id="facilitating-rolling-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Facilitating Rolling Budgets</h3>
<p>Cisco uses an 18-month rolling budget versus a static budget.</p>
<p>Advantages: Keeps budget more current in a changing environment
Managers may react in a more timely manner by better integrating
planning and execution.</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Costs of software and management time Key Solution:
Use a single standardized web page for data entry and automatic roll up
to the company-wide budget.</p>
</section>
<section id="budget-lapsing" class="slide level3">
<h3>Budget Lapsing</h3>
<p>Budget lapsing is a requirement that funds allocated for a particular
year cannot be carried over to the following year.</p>
<p>Advantages: Tighter control than budgets that do not lapse Prevents
risk-averse managers from accumulating funds</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Encourages wasteful spending near end of fiscal
year</p>
</section>
<section id="static-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Static Budgets</h3>
<p>Do not vary with volume, such as costs that should be fixed</p>
<p>Volume changes may create budget variances</p>
<p>Since managers are not insulated from volume changes, they have
incentives to mitigate impact of adverse volume changes</p>
</section>
<section id="flexible-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Flexible Budgets</h3>
<p>Do adjust for changes in volume, such as semivariable costs that
include a fixed and variable component</p>
<p>Evaluate performance after adjusting for volume effects</p>
<p>Manager is not held responsible for volume changes</p>
<p><strong>See Self-Study Problems.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="incremental-vs.-zero-based-budgets" class="slide level3">
<h3>Incremental vs. Zero-Based Budgets</h3>
<p>Incremental budgeting: Begin with current year’s core budget and make
incremental changes Review focuses on incremental changes and may ignore
inefficiencies in core budget</p>
<p>Zero-based budgeting (ZBB): Mandates each line item in total must be
justified each year Motivates managers to eliminate inefficient expenses
Useful when firm is changing strategic direction Becomes less useful
when same justifications are used each year</p>
</section>
<section id="appendix-master-budget-example" class="slide level3">
<h3>Appendix: Master Budget Example</h3>
<p><strong>Study Figure 6-3.</strong></p>
<p>Logical relationships Sales budget drives production and purchasing
Production drives materials and labor budget Production and sales drive
inventory and cost of goods sold</p>
<p>Master budget statements Budgeted income statement Budgeted balance
sheet Budgeted cash flows</p>
</section>
<section id="budgets-and-economic-darwinism" class="slide level3">
<h3>Budgets and Economic Darwinism</h3>
<p>Budgets may result in suboptimal performance because: Too much
emphasis on financial rather than nonfinancial measures Short-term
rather long-term results Maximizing incentive bonuses for manager rather
than firm value Too much time analyzing budget variances</p>
<p>Despite all these problems, budgets persist in firms.</p>
<p>The economic Darwinism principle implies budgeting must be yielding
benefits at least as large as their costs.</p>
