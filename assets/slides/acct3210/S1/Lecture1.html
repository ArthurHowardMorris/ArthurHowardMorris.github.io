<h2>Simple Definition</h2>
<p><strong>Management accounting is <em>internal</em> accounting.</strong></p>
<p>This definition separates managerial accounting from other forms of <em>external</em> accounting in helpful ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Financial or Public Accounting</strong>: External accounting for compliance with IFRS, GAAP, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Accounting:</strong> External accounting for compliance with tax laws.</li>

<h2>Is the external=financial/tax and internal=management distinction enough?</h2>
<ul>
<li>On one hand, this is a helpful framing because it emphasizes that the accounting activity in the external domains is determined by accounting rules.</li>

<p>Inability to clearly define the accounting activity beyond compliance is the root of two current problems in the accounting field:</p>

<li>The role of accounting as the ‘language of business’ has been largely ceded to data science and business intelligence functions.</li>
<li>Focus on compliance with formal regulatory requirements has created a profession specialized in tasks which are at high risk of automation.</li>

<h2>Zimmerman’s Answer (1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The controller, the firm’s chief management accountant, has responsibility for data collection and reporting. The controller compiles the data to prepare the firm’s balance sheet, income statement, and tax returns. In addition, this person prepares the internal reports for the various divisions and departments within the firm and helps other managers by providing them with the data to make decisions-as well as the data to evaluate these managers’ performance.”</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>“The controllership function at the corporate, division, and plant levels involves assisting decision-making and control. The controller must balance providing information to other managers for decision making against providing monitoring information to top executives for use in controlling the behavior of lower-level managers.”</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>“The importance of the internal control system cannot be stressed enough. Throughout this book, we use the term control to mean aligning the interests of employees with maximizing the value of the firm. The most basic conflict of interest between employees and owners is employee theft.”</em></p>

<h2>Summary of 1 &amp; 2</h2>
<p>This is a solid way to think about management accounting. It has a few weaknesses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>These are still just collections of tasks, hence why so much of it has been sliced off into data science or automated. We still lack a compelling framework for the fundamental function of management accounting.</li>
<li>max(Firm Value)–see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html">Friedman (1970)</a>–comes close to this, but it may not be consistent with stable (viable) systems as it leaves no level of the firm without the incentives control is concerned with. it unclear whether this is consistent with the existence of firms as viable systems.</li>
<li>There is a fundamental disconnect between the use of information for control and for decisions.

<h2>The resource bargain</h2>
<!-- Zimmerman is focused on incentive alignment, this is good. -->
<!-- But to him all incentives are monetary. -->
<p>In the viable systems model, resources flow through the firm based on ongoing negotiations between the business units. The ‘resource bargain’ is the active negotiation and agreement process whereby:</p>
<ul>
<li>System 3 allocates resources and sets targets for operational units</li>
<li>System 1 units commit to delivering specific outcomes</li>
<li>Both sides agree on performance metrics and accountability system 2 coordinates the process.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-resource-bargain-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>The resource bargain</h2>
<p>System 3 is responsible for facilitating a negotiation and agreement process that meets the strategic goals and plans set at the higher levels of the firm. The framing of this process as a negotiation subsumes Zimmerman’s focus on monetary incentives and pay for performance. This is one of many ways to achieve resource bargain.</p>
