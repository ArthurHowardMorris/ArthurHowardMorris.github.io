# Roadmap for Lecture 1

  1. Review Resources and Policies 
  2. Why are we here? What is 'Management Accounting'?

# Review Resources and Policies 

  - [Syllabus](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/resources/semesters/s2025/acct3210syl.html)
  - [Canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/60833)
  - [Lecture Slides and Examples](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/resources/semesters/s2025/acct3210.html)

# Why are we here? 

## To Study _ADVANCED_ Management Accounting...

- But what is management accounting?
- And how will we make this 'advanced'?

## Simple Definition

__Management accounting is _internal_ accounting.__ 

This definition separates managerial accounting from other forms of _external_
accounting in helpful ways:

1. __Financial or Public Accounting__: External accounting for compliance with IFRS, GAAP, etc.
2. __Tax Accounting:__ External accounting for compliance with tax laws.


## In the external=financial/tax and internal=management distinction enough?

- On one hand, this is a helpful framing because it emphasizes that the
  accounting activity in the external domains is determined by accounting rules. 
- On the other hand, this is not a helpful framing, because it does not
  actually tell us what management accounting _is_.

## This is not just a problem for this class...

<!-- TODO: we could dig into the history of management accounting here. etc  -->

Inability to clearly define the accounting activity beyond compliance is the
root of two current problems in the accounting field:

  1. The role of accounting as the 'language of business' has been largely
     ceded to data science and business intelligence functions.
  2. Focus on compliance with formal regulatory requirements has created a
     profession specialized in tasks which are at high risk of automation.

# What is Management Accounting? Four Answers

1. Accounting for Decision Making (Business Intelligence/Data Science). 
2. Accounting for Control (Internal Audit/Performance-Evaluation).
3. A collection of topics related to how information, incentives, and resources
   move through an organization.
4. Facilitators of the resource bargains within the organization, critical to
   its survival as a viable system.

 (Zimmerman 10e p.9-11)


## Accounting for decision making 

> "___The controller, the firm's chief management accountant, has responsibility
> for data collection and reporting__. The controller __compiles the data__ to
> prepare the firm's balance sheet, income statement, and tax returns. In
> addition, this person __prepares the internal reports__ for the various divisions
> and departments within the firm and __helps other managers by providing them
> with the data to make decisions__-as well as the __data to evaluate these
> managers' performance.___" (Zimmerman 10e p.9)

## Accounting for decision making is ground that our profession has lost

- We can either give up this ground, or learn the tools we need to win this ground back.
- We will do the latter in this class.

## Accounting for Control

> _"The importance of the internal control system cannot be stressed enough.
> Throughout this book, we use the term control to mean aligning the interests
> of employees with __maximizing the value of the firm__. The most basic conflict
> of interest between employees and owners is employee theft."_

## Accounting for Control 

This has three aspects: 

1. Catching fraud. (Internal audit)
2. "Managing costs and profitability." (Increase profits by means we control)
3. Measuring performance. (Incentive alignment)

## Summary of 1 & 2

This is a solid way to think about management accounting. It has a few weaknesses:

1. These are still just collections of tasks, hence why so much of it has been
   sliced off into data science or automated. We still lack a compelling
framework for the fundamental function of management accounting.
3. max(Firm Value)--see [Friedman
   (1970)](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html)--comes
close to this, but it may not be consistent with stable (viable) systems as it
leaves no level of the firm without the incentives control is concerned with.
it unclear whether this is consistent with the existence of firms as viable
systems. 
1. There is a fundamental disconnect between the use of information for control
   and for decisions. 
   - If you pay me based on a number, I will only make that number go up.

## A collection of topics 

- These are good topics. We will cover most, if not all, of them.
- The flow of resources, information, and incentives through an organization is
  a good way to think about what management accounting is.
- But a list of topics is not a definition, and it's not a justification for a
  profession, and it's not a reason for us to not be automated out of jobs, and
  it's not enough of a reason for us to be here. 
- We need a unifying theory of management accounting.

# Resource Bargains in a Viable System

## The Viable System Model

- Comes from the study of complex systems in nature. Stafford Beer and other
management scientists took observations about how complex systems in nature
survive and applied them to organizations.
- The model identifies 5 systems that function in a viable system. 

## The Viable System Model

- Note that this model is recursive, with systems nesting within systems.
- It is natural to think of a firm as a whole as a system, but we could also
  zoom in to a department, or zoom out to an industry, or zoom out further to a
  global economy. Our focus will be the firm as a whole.

## The Viable System Model

### Immediate and internal systems:

- __System 1:__ Operational units that perform primary activities
- __System 2:__ Coordination mechanisms that resolve conflicts between operational units
- __System 3:__ Internal regulation, resources allocation, performance monitoring

### Future-oriented and external systems:

- __System 4:__ Intelligence functions dealing with the external environment and future planning
- __System 5:__ Policy and identity, setting overall direction and purpose

### Management accounting is the interface between the immediate and future-oriented systems

## The resource bargain 

<!-- Zimmerman is focused on incentive alignment, this is good. -->
<!-- But to him all incentives are monetary. -->

  In the viable systems model, resources flow through
the firm based on ongoing negotiations between the business units. The
'resource bargain' is the active negotiation and agreement process whereby: 

- System 3 allocates resources and sets targets for operational units
- System 1 units commit to delivering specific outcomes
- Both sides agree on performance metrics and accountability system 2 coordinates the process.

## The resource bargain 

System 3 is responsible for facilitating a negotiation and agreement process
that meets the strategic goals and plans set at the higher levels of the firm.
The framing of this process as a negotiation subsumes Zimmerman's focus on
monetary incentives and pay for performance. This is one of many ways to
achieve resource bargain.

## Management accounting as a facilitator of the resource bargain 

In the VSM version of the firm the management accounting function (Comptroller)
is located in system 3 and is critical to the establishment and function of the
resource bargain.

1. Responsible for measurement of System 1 & 2 operations.
2. This allows system 1 & 2 to fine-tune without interfering with higher levels.
3. Translate strategic goals into operational targets to inform the resource bargain.

# Example: A Manufacturing Firm

## System 1: Operations

- Production lines and assembly
- Warehousing operations
- Distribution centers

## System 2: Coordination

- Production scheduling
- Quality control standards
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

## System 3: Internal Management

- The Comptroller (management accountant)
- Operations management
- Resource allocation (optimization)
- Performance monitoring

## System 4: Intelligence & Development

- Research & Development
- Market research
- Strategic planning

## System 5: Policy & Identity

- Board governance
- Corporate strategy
- Mission and values

CEO is often here, though in many cases (especially in 'founder mode') the CEO
may be involved in system 3. In startups one person may do many of these jobs,
or groups may do them at different times.

# How will we make this 'advanced'?

1. The 'Tools' section of the course is intended to give you a starting point
   for winning back some of the ground lost to other fields.
2. In addition to introducing traditional management accounting topics, we will
   also evaluate them in terms of their contribution to the viability of the
  firm. We will think carefully both about how a firm succeeds (is viable) and
  fails.
