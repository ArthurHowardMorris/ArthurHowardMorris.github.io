## Multinational transfer pricing and taxation.

Vik-Giger Corporation, headquartered in the U.S., manufactures state-of-the-art
milling machines. It has two marketing subsidiaries, one in Brazil and one in
Switzerland, that sell its products. Vik-Giger is considering building one new
machine, at a cost of \$500,000. There is no market for the equipment in the
United States. The equipment can be sold in Brazil for \$1,000,000, but the
Brazilian subsidiary would incur transportation and modification costs of
\$200,000. Alternatively, the equipment can be sold in Switzerland for \$950,000,
but the Swill subsidiary would incur transportation and modification costs of
\$250,000. The U.S. company can sell the equipment either to its Brazilian
subsidiary or to its Swiss subsidiary but not to both. Vik-Giger Corporation and
its subsidiaries operate in a very decentralized manner. Managers in each
company have considerable autonomy, with each division manager interested in
maximizing his or her own division’s income.

### Questions:

1. From the viewpoint of Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries taken together, should
   Vik-Giger Corporation manufacture the equipment? If it does, where should it
   sell the equipment to maximize corporate operating income? What would the
   operating income for Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries be from the sale? Ignore
   any income tax effects.
2. What range of transfer prices will result in achieving the actions deter-
   mined to be optimal in requirement 1? Explain your answer. 
3. The effective income tax rates for this transaction follow: 40\% in the
   United States, 60\% in Brazil, and 15\% in Switzerland. The tax authorities
   in the three countries are uncertain about the cost of the intermediate
   product and will allow any transfer price between \$500,000 and \$700,000.
   If Vik-Giger and its subsidiaries want to maximize after-tax operating
   income:
   - (a) should the equipment be manufactured and 
   - (b) where and at what price should it be transferred?
4. Now suppose each manager acts autonomously to maximize his or her own
subsidiary’s after-tax operating income. The tax authorities will allow
transfer prices only between \$500,000 and \$700,000. Which subsidiary will get
the product and at what price? Is your answer the same as your answer in
requirement 3? Explain why or why not.
