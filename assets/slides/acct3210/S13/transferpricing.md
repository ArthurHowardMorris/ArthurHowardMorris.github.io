## Overview

Based on a note by Nahum Melumad, adapted by Steve Huddart.

An essential feature of decentralized firms is _responsibility centers_ (e.g.,
cost-, profit-, revenue-, or investment-centers).

- What does "decentralized" mean?
- The location of decision rights.

The performance of these responsibility centers is evaluated on the basis of
various accounting numbers, such as standard cost, divisional profit, or return
on investment (as well as on the basis of other non-accounting measures, like
market share). 


One function of the management accounting system therefore is to
attach a dollar figure to transactions between different responsibility
centers. 

The _transfer price_ is the price that one division of a company
charges another division of the same company for a product transferred between
the two divisions.

The basic purpose of transfer pricing is to induce optimal decision making in a
decentralized organization (i.e., in most cases, to maximize the profit of the
organization as a whole).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Decentralization

### Advantages

- Decisions are better and more timely because of the manager’s proximity to
  local conditions.
- Top managers are not distracted by routine, local decision problems.
- Managers’ motivation increases because they have more control over results.
- Increased decision making provides better training for managers for higher
  level positions in the future.

### Disadvantages

- Lack of goal congruence among managers in different parts of the
  organization.
- Insufficient information available to top management; increased costs of
  obtaining detailed information.
- Lack of coordination among managers in different parts of the organization.

## Purposes of Transfer Pricing

There are two main reasons for instituting a transfer pricing scheme:

- _Performance measurement_: Use the transfer price to separate profit figures
  for each division and thereby evaluate the performance of each division
  separately.
- _Coordination_: Provide information to coordinate production, sales and
  pricing decisions of the different divisions (via an appropriate choice of
  transfer prices).
- Transfer prices make managers aware of the value that goods
  and services have for other segments of the firm.
- Transfer pricing allows the company to generate profit (or cost) figures for
  each division separately.
- The transfer price will affect not only the reported profit of each center,
  but will also affect the allocation of an organization’s resources.

## Mechanics of Transfer Pricing

- No money need change hands between the two divisions. The transfer price might
only be used for internal record keeping. 
- (Transfer Price × quantity of goods
exchanged) is an expense for the purchasing center and a revenue for the
selling center.

## Accounting for Transfer Pricing


If intra-company transactions are accounted for at prices in excess of cost,
appropriate elimination entries should be made for external reporting purposes.
Examples of items to be eliminated for consolidated financial statements
include:

- Intracompany receivables and payables.
- Intracompany sales and costs of goods sold.
- Intracompany profits in inventories.

## Alternative Methods of Transfer Pricing

A transfer pricing policy defines rules for calculating the transfer price. In
addition, a transfer price policy has to specify sourcing rules (i.e., either
mandate internal transactions or allow divisions discretion in choosing whether
to buy/sell externally). The most common transfer pricing methods are described
below.

### Market-based Transfer Pricing

When the outside market for the good is _well-defined_, _competitive_, and _stable_,
firms often use the market price as an upper bound for the transfer price.

_Terms:_
- what is a well defined market?
- what is a competitive market?
- what is a stable market?

- Why do we need these to hold for external transfer pricing to be useful?

- the prices need to be informative in order to measure effort (remember Huck Finn)
- the prices need to be informative for future planning 

### Concerns with market-based Transfer Pricing

When the outside market is neither _competitive_ nor stable, internal decision
making may be distorted by reliance on market-based transfer prices

e.g. if competitors are selling at distress prices or are engaged in any of a
variety of “special” pricing strategies (e.g., price discrimination, product
tie-ins, or entry deterrence). 

Also, when entering a new product market the firm may opt to provide an inernal
subsidy to the new business segment.

### Negotiated Transfer Pricing 

Here, the firm does not specify rules for the determination of transfer prices.

- Divisional managers are encouraged to negotiate a mutually agreeable transfer
  price. 
- Negotiated transfer pricing is typically combined with free sourcing. 
- In some companies, though, headquarters reserves the right to mediate the
  negotiation process and impose an “arbitrated” solution.

### Cost-based Transfer Pricing

In the absence of an established market price many companies base the transfer
price on the production cost of the supplying division.

The most common methods are:

- Full Cost
- Cost-plus
- Variable Cost plus Lump Sum charge
- Variable Cost plus Opportunity cost
- Dual Transfer Prices

Each of these methods is outlined below.

### Full Cost

A popular transfer price because of its clarity and convenience and because it
is often viewed as a satisfactory approximation of outside market prices.

- Full actual costs can include inefficiencies; thus its usage for transfer
  pricing often fails to provide an incentive to control such inefficiencies.
- Use of full standard costs may minimize the inefficiencies mentioned above.

### Cost-plus

- When transfers are made at full cost, the buying division takes all the gains
  from trade while the supplying division receives none
- To overcome this problem the supplying division is frequently allowed to add
  a mark-up in order to make a “reasonable” profit
- The transfer price may then be viewed as an approximate market price.


### Variable Cost plus a Lump Sum Charge

In order to motivate the buying division to make appropriate purchasing
decisions, the transfer price could be set equal to (standard) variable cost
plus a lump-sum periodical charge covering the supplying division’s related
fixed costs.

### Variable Cost plus Opportunity Cost

Also know as the Minimum Transfer Price:

Minimum Transfer Price = Incremental Cost + Opportunity Cost.

For internal decision making purposes, a transfer price should be at least as
large as the sum of:

- cash outflows that are directly associated with the production of the
  transferred goods; and,
- the contribution margin foregone by the firm as a whole if the goods are
  transferred internally.

Sub-optimal decisions can result from the natural inclination of the manager of
an autonomous buying division to view a mix of variable and fixed costs of a
selling division plus, possibly, a mark-up as variable costs of his buying
division. Dual transfer pricing can address this problem, although it
introduces the complexity of using different prices for different managers.

### Dual Transfer Prices

To avoid some of the problems associated with the above schemes, some companies
adopt a dual transfer pricing system. For example:
- Charge the buyer for the variable cost. The objective is to motivate the
  manager of the buying division to make optimal (short-term) decisions.
- Credit the seller at a price that allows for a normal profit margin. This
  facilitates a “fair” evaluation of the selling division’s performance.
