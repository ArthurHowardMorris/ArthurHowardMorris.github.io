    "> _By 1960, Long Island's Levittown had eighty-two thousand residents--and they were all white. Many factors contributed to the strict segregation by class, or at least income, and especially by race, that characterized--perhaps even defined--the new suburban America._\n",
    "\n",
    "> _America was a profoundly racist society, by history, by law and custom, and by inclination. But on the list of contributing factors was deliberate, government-enforced intention at every level, local to federal. Government--as policy maker and as judiciary--imposed and enforced racial segregation. FHA was not only the main federal government player in suburban development, but principal promoter of suburban racial segregation. FHA insurance was available only after a property had been rigorously and professionally appraised--only correct practice for what quickly became the world's biggest property insurer. The elaborate guidelines it developed for professional  appraisal quickly became the professional template. The FHA appraisal forms gave points for social as well as physical conditions in determining the value of the property, and racial segregation figured prominently in this government protocol._\n",
    "\n",
    "> _As Michael Carliner, economist at the National Association of Homebuilders, wrote, \"The FHA underwriting standard included a mandate that the neighborhood be 'homogeneous' (segregated), with that homogeneity preferably assured through racist restrictive covenants, for which the FHA helpfully supplied forms.\"_\n",
