# Outline:

- Why this paper deserves our attention.
- Thoughts on improvement.
    1. The setting as a laboratory.
    2. One research question.
    3. Clear predictions.

# Why this paper deserves our attention:

- Most of the research in Accounting and Finance is about how incentives _work_.
- Pathological incentives are understudied.
- Quality of care is vital.
- Excellent work designing a survey to complement archival data.


# Thoughts on improvement:

1. The setting as a laboratory.
2. One research question.
3. Clear predictions.

# The setting as a laboratory: Germany

- Every national healthcare system is an experiment in delivery of effective care.
- Each system has advantages and disadvantages for researchers and patients.
- The German system deserves consideration _per se_.

# The setting as a laboratory: Germany

- A clear discussion of how your setting lets you see things previous researchers could not.
    - This will help readers understand your approach and contribution.
    - A clear taxonomy of healthcare will help. (single payer/single provider/independent doctors/etc.)

# The setting as a laboratory: Chief Physicians

- Why do we need a study about chief physicians? 
    - The title raises this question, it should be clear in the first few paragraphs.

# The setting as a laboratory: Chief Physicians

- If we are interested in quality of care, and incentives (we are), then clarifying the roll of the chief physician in determining quality of care is essential.
    - In the US context the attending physician has direct influence on the quality of care.
- A simple model of the hospital's/physician's production function may add clarity.
- If the production function is not separable (e.g. Cobb-Douglas) and some inputs are unobservable, then positive weights on observables may lead to high pay and zero output.


# One research question:

The study lists several research questions:

1. Which performance measures are relevant for chief physicians’ compensation-based controls?
2. Which performance measures are relevant for chief physicians’ non-compensation based controls?
3. How do compensation-based controls and non-compensation based controls affect the quality of care?

Based on the title, and my interest, I recommend focusing on 3.

# Clear predictions:

- Based on theory and institutional details
- It seems like you have strong priors about the interaction between compensation and non-compensation controls
- State them, highlight the tension
- Focus empirics on the research question

# Minor issues:

- Reconsider the terminology: monetary and non-monetary incentives.
- Keep  monetary/non-monetary separate from qualitative/quantitative performance measures.
