## Course description

Managers rely on accounting information to design and implement control systems.
This course builds on Principles of Accounting II (ACCT 2200) to prepare
students to produce, evaluate, and use this information and these systems.
Topics covered include decision-making techniques, analysis of cost behavior,
allocation of common and joint costs, use of cost information in operational and
strategic decisions, transfer pricing, performance measurement, and incentive
compensation, with an emphasis on using data science to bring accounting
information into the decision process.

We will pay particular attention to how control systems can be designed to
manage human and "AI" agents, with an emphasis on how the problems of managing
complex organizations are part of the same line of inquiry as the study of
Artificial Intelligence.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

<!--TODO: add control systems language here-->

1. Understand both the importance of management accounting for companies’
   designing the control systems that generate
   strategic and operational decisions and the pitfalls of misusing management
   accounting information and techniques.  
2. Understand the resource bargain that arises in organizations, and how
   accounting information can be used to manage this bargain.  
3. Solve problems arising in business planning, with the aid of mathematical
   and statistical tools.  
4. Evaluate various techniques for control and performance evaluation in a
   decentralized environment, and provide recommendations for an effective
   control systems.
5. Understand how these concepts apply to human and "AI" agents: similarities,
   differences, and prospects.
6. Understand how managerial and financial accounting relate to data analytics,
   data science, and business intelligence.  

The course will also provide you with opportunities to:

7. Use data to make business decisions.  
8. Think through a variety of business problems.  
<!-- 6. Demonstrate team-work and leadership skills in solving operational and -->
   <!-- strategic planning problems. -->
9. Demonstrate communication skills through class participation and case
   discussions.

## Course Structure and Mode of Instruction

<!-- note that the width of the tables in the doc is controlled by the width of the header row, so don't let table mode move the top row -->

| | |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| _Mode&nbsp;of Instruction:_   | The course will be conducted _in-person_ and will involve class participation.|
| _Lectures and Cases:_    | Class discussions will involve both lectures and cases. Case discussions will occur on days when the cases are assigned in the course schedule below.                                                                                                                                |
| _Preparation for Class:_ | Students should prepare for class by completing the assigned reading and problems or case. All assignments and cases are due at 18:00 (6:00 PM) the evening following class.                                                                                                                                           |
| _Canvas:_                | Assignments will be turned in via Canvas, and I will use canvas to send updates. Please note that the [__course website__ (__LINK__)](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/resources/semesters/s2026/acct3210.html), and _not Canvas_ will host the slides and syllabus. Also note that canvas will track the _unweighted_ points for the course.  |
| _Communication:_         | All questions about lecture content should be submitted in the canvas forum for the lecture, and will be addressed either in review sessions or in the forum posts. Other questions should be addressed to the T.A. via email with "ACCT 3210" and your section in the subject line. |


<!--| _Video Recordings:_      | No recordings of this class will be distributed. This is to facilitate class participation.                                                                                                                                                                                          |-->

## Grading

### Grading Scheme

|Description          | Weight|
| ---                 | ---   |
| Class Participation | 16% |
| Cases & Problems    | 16% |
| Midterm             | 18% |
| Final Exam          | 50% |  
| Total               | 100%|

### Class Participation

Class participation scores will be based on participation in class discussions.
There are three ways to participate: [_iPRS questionnaires_](https://iprs.ust.hk/), verbal participation in class discussions, and both asking and answering questions on the Canvas forums.
<!--dishonest, and will be treated as [academic-->
<!--misconduct](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/regulations-student-conduct-and-academic-integrity).-->

<!--I will begin counting attendance on the 18th of February (i.e. after the end of-->
<!--the add/drop period), but we will use iPRS in class each day to ensure that all-->
<!--students understand how it works, and to facilitate interactive learning. In-->
<!--the grading scheme above, the 16% awarded based on class participation will be-->
<!--allocated as follows:-->

<!-- | Classes Missed | Percent Awarded | -->
<!-- |----------------|-----------------| -->
<!-- | 1              | 100%            | -->
<!-- | 2              | 92%             | -->
<!-- | 3              | 73%             | -->
<!-- | 4              | 36%             | -->
<!-- | 5              | 0%              | -->

<!-- #### Support for Interviews and Internships -->

<!--Many students will have to miss class in order to pursue valuable opportunities, such as job interviews and internships. The following policy is intended to support students progress while maintaining the integrity of this course as an in-person synchronous exercise.-->

<!--Students may get participation credit for one absence missed due to interviews, internships, and similar opportunities, by submitting a short essay (500-750) words discussing how one of the lectures relates to the work you are doing or will do. Please note that while this essay is short and will be graded based on completion, I expect concrete detail about both the lecture and the organization that you are describing. If the essay is overly general (i.e. the discussion could apply to any organization or lecture) I may ask for a more detailed revision of the essay. These essays are to be submitted to the TA via email with me in CC by the 29th of April.-->

<!--_Note on the use of LLM/GPT output for this assignment: You may prepare this assignment however you wish; however, my expectations for the level of detail about this course and the opportunity you are pursuing are unlikely to be amenable to generation by any model trained on the general corpora used in the production of current widely used tools, without carefully engineered prompts. If you do use these resources I would like to know for my own enlightenment._-->

### Cases & Problems

Cases and problems will be due at 1800 the night after the class in which they
are discussed. All assignments should be submitted in the formats specified in
Canvas, and are graded on completion only. Students who miss assignments
because they add the course after the start of the semester may turn in any of
the assignments they miss until the first exam without penalty.

__Feedback on Cases and Problems:__ I will provide detailed discussion of the
problems in class after they are due, this feedback will help you prepare for
the examination. Please raise questions in the class discussion, or via the
canvas discussion. This ensures that all students have access to the same
information as they prepare for the exam.

### Exams

Exams will be conducted in-person and will be closed book.

- __Midterm Exam:__
  <!-- - The midterm exam is scheduled from __1800__ to __1900__ on -->

     All students are required to take the midterm exam at this pre-scheduled time,
     and there will be no make-up exam for it. Students absent from the midterm
     exam will receive zero mark for this component, except for highly unusual
     circumstances that cannot be controlled and avoided by the student---in which
     case the grade weight on the midterm exam will be loaded to the final
     examination component. Solutions to the midterm exam will be reviewed _in class_.

  - __Feedback on Midterm Exam:__ I will discuss each problem from the
       midterm exam, as scheduled below, so that you have a chance to prepare for
       the final exam.
  - __Mid-term Exam Conflicts:__ Every semester a few students have conflicting
      mid-term exams.
      <!-- Once the mid-term exam is confirmed by the University,  -->
      Please let the TA know if you have a conflict and we will make arrangements.

- __Final Exam:__ <!-- The comprehensive final examination is scheduled from-->

  - The exam is closed book. Communication with others, use of any resources not provided in the exam is cheating and not allowed.

## Course Schedule and Outline

The contents of this course are divided into three sections: (1) Tools, (2)
Theory, (3) Cost Allocation. The midterm will cover sections (1) and (2), while
the final exam will cover all three sections.

Section 1 will cover the fundamentals of data and analytical analysis needed to
apply the ideas of managerial accounting to actual business data and decisions.
Section 2 will cover classic ideas like the time value of money, and tax
strategy, with an emphasis on how incentives and strategies vary across
individuals and over time. This section will also emphasize the incentive
conflicts that arise throughout organizations, and how organizations can be
designed to manage these problems. Finally, Section 3 will present cost
allocation as a way to either solve or cause the incentive problems introduced
in Section 2, and as an application of the tools presented in Section 1.

### Compliance Section

#### Mandated Policy on "Artificial Intelligence"

The use of any of the tools commonly referred to as "AI" in the graded
assessments of this course is covered by the prohibition on the use of outside
resources. In order to comply with the HKUST CEI policy on Generative
Artificial Intelligence this should be interpreted as a prohibition on the use
of these tools in the exams.

Students are encouraged to use whatever tools they find most effective in
preparation for the exams and for completion of the assignments. As the
assignments are graded only on completion no further restrictions apply.

#### Mapping "Assessment Tasks" to "Intended Learning Outcomes"

The [HKUST CTLQ](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/undergraduate-course-syllabus-template?check_logged_in=1) has helpfully advised that:

> _"With a clearly stated criterion-referenced model that includes the CILOs,
> assessment components and the rubrics on the syllabus, it is expected that
> misunderstanding about the assessment model would be minimized where both
> instructors and students may enjoy the transparency of the necessary course
> information."_

The "Assessment Tasks" listed in the "Grading Scheme" section above map to the
course objectives, which I will refer to as "ILOs" to match the usage in the
syllabus template approved by CTLQ, as follows:

| Assessment Task | ILO | Explanation |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Class Participation | ILO 6-8 | Class participation offers students the opportunity to demonstrate communication skills, and to think through a variety of business problems. |
| Cases & Problems    | ILO 1-7 | The content of the cases and problems is designed to cover the content of the course while addressing ILOs 1-7. |
| Midterm             | ILO 1-7 | The midterm exam will cover the content of the course, and will be designed to test the students' understanding of the material with respect to ILOs 1-7. |
| Final Exam          | ILO 1-7 |  The midterm exam will cover the content of the course, and will be designed to test the students' understanding of the material with respect to ILOs 1-7. |

### Acknowledgements

Like Bob Dylan, this course was born a long way away from where it's from, but
the starting point was reading Joel Demski's _Managerial Uses of Accounting
Information_, Zimmerman's _Accounting for Decision Making and Control_, and
reviewing Steve Huddart's excellent Accounting 440 taught at Penn State. The course has
Similarities to those approaches are absolutely intentional, and any
shortcomings are my attempts at innovation.
