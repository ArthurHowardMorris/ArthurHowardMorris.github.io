## Course description:

Managers rely on accounting information to guide operations. This course builds
on Principles of Accounting II (ACCT 2200) to prepare students to produce,
evaluate, and use this information. Topics covered include decision-making
techniques, analysis of cost behavior, allocation of common and joint costs,
use of cost information in operational and strategic decisions, transfer
pricing, and performance measurement, and incentive compensation, with an
emphasis on using data science to bring accounting information into the
decision process.

## Course Objectives:
By the end of this course, you should be able to:

1. Use real data to make business decisions.
2. Understand both the importance of management accounting for companies’
   strategic and operational decisions and the pitfalls of misusing management
   accounting information and techniques.  
2. Solve problems arising in business planning, with the aid of mathematical
   and statistical tools.  
3. Evaluate various techniques for control and performance evaluation in a
   decentralized environment, and provide recommendations for an effective
   control system.  
4. Understand how managerial and financial accounting relate to data analytics,
   data science, and business intelligence.  

The course will also provide you with opportunities to:

5. Think through a variety of business problems.  
6. Demonstrate team-work and leadership skills in solving operational and
   strategic planning problems.  
7. Demonstrate communication skills through class participation and case
   discussions.  

## Course Materials:
The materials that you need to prepare for each session will be provided via
the Canvas site. Presentation slides, and resources, will be posted on the
course website.

### Optional Textbook:

_Any format, any addition. "Connect" is not required._ Many course assignments are based on
this text, but all the materials that you need will be provided though the
course canvas site.

## Course Structure and Mode of Instruction:

<!-- note that the width of the tables in the doc is controlled by the width of the header row, so don't let table mode move the top row -->

| | | 
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| _Mode&nbsp;of Instruction:_   | The course will be conducted _in-person_ and will involve class participation.| 
| _Lectures and Cases:_    | Class discussions will involve both lectures and cases. Case discussions will occur on days when the cases are assigned in the course schedule below.                                                                                                                                |
| _Preparation for Class:_ | Students should prepare for class by completing the assigned reading and problems or case. All assignments and cases are due before class.                                                                                                                                           |
| _Video Recordings:_      | No recordings of this class will be distributed. This is to facilitate class participation.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| _Canvas:_                | Assignments will be turned in via Canvas, and I will use canvas to send updates. Please note that this website, and _not Canvas_ will host the slides and syllabus . Also note that the Canvas gradebook will only track assignments turned in via Canvas and not your final grade.  |
| _Communication:_         | All questions about lecture content should be submitted in the canvas forum for the lecture, and will be addressed either in review sessions or in the forum posts. Other questions should be addressed to the T.A. via email with "ACCT 3210" and your section in the subject line. |

## Grading

### Grading Scheme

|Description          |	Weight|
| ---                 | ---   |
| Class Participation |	16% |
| Cases & Problems    | 16% |
| Midterm             | 18% |
| Final Exam          | 50% |  
| Total	              | 100%|

### Class Participation:

Class participation scores will be based on attendance, you are expected to
attend the section for which you are registered. Attendance will be taken using
[_iPRS_](https://iprs.ust.hk/), supplemented by in-person cold calling. Please note that indicating that
you are in attendance when you are not physically in the classroom is
dishonest, and will be treated as [academic
misconduct](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/regulations-student-conduct-and-academic-integrity).

I will begin counting attendance on the 19th of February (i.e. after the end of
the add/drop period), but we will use the attendance app in class each day to
ensure that all students understand how the app works. In the grading scheme
above, the 16% awarded based on class participation will be allocated as follows: 


| Classes Missed | Percent Awarded |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 1              | 100%            |
| 2              | 92%             |
| 3              | 73%             |
| 4              | 36%             |
| 5              | 0%              |

### Cases & Problems

Cases and problems will be due at 2200 the night before the class in which they
are discussed. All assignments should be submitted in the formats specified in
Canvas, and are graded on completion only. Students who miss assignments
because they add the course after the start of the semester may turn in any of
the assignments they miss until the first exam without penalty.

__Feedback on Cases and Problems:__ I will provide detailed discussion of the
problems in class after they are due, this feedback will help you prepare for
the examination. Please raise questions in the class discussion, or via the
canvas discussion. This ensures that all students have access to the same
information as they prepare for the exam.

### Exams

Exams will be conducted in-person and will be closed book. Times and locations TBA.

 - __Midterm Exam:__ The midterm examination is scheduled from _TBA_ to _TBA_
     in person. Locations: _TBA_ (see Canvas for maps, and room assignments). The
     exam is closed book and communication with others is cheating and not allowed.
     All students are required to take the midterm exam at this pre-scheduled time,
     and there will be no make-up exam for it. Students absent from the midterm
     exam will receive zero mark for this component, except for highly unusual
     circumstances that cannot be controlled and avoided by the student---in which
     case the grade weight on the midterm exam will be loaded to the final
     examination component. Solutions to the midterm exam will be reviewed in class.

    - __Feedback on Midterm Exam:__ I will discuss each problem from the
        midterm exam, as scheduled below, so that you have a chance to prepare for
        the final exam.

- __Final Exam:__ The comprehensive final examination is scheduled from _TBA_
    to _TBA_ on _TBA_  in _TBA_. The exam is closed book and communication with
    others is cheating and not allowed. All students are required to take the final
    exam at this pre-scheduled time, and there will be no make-up exam for it.
    Students absent from the final exam will receive zero mark for this component. 

### Grading Scale:

Points on all work will be weighted as shown above and graded as shown here:

| Grade | %               |
|-------|-----------------|
| A+    | 97.00% - 100%   |
| A     | 93.00% - 96.99% |
| A-    | 90.00% - 92.99% |
| B+    | 87.00% - 89.99% |
| B     | 83.00% - 86.99% |
| B-    | 80.00% - 82.99% |
| C+    | 77.00% - 79.99% |
| C     | 73.00% - 76.99% |
| C-    | 70.00% - 72.99% |
| D     | 60.00% - 69.99% |
| F     | Below 60.00%    |

## Course Schedule and Outline:

The contents of this course are divided into three sections: (1) Tools, (2)
Theory, (3) Cost Allocation. The midterm will cover sections (1) and (2), while
the final exam will cover all three sections.

Section 1 will cover the fundamentals of data and analytical analysis needed to
apply the ideas of managerial accounting to actual business data and decisions.
Section 2 will cover classic ideas like the time value of money, and tax
strategy, with an emphasis on how incentives and strategies vary across
individuals and over time. This section will also emphasize the incentive
conflicts that arise throughout organizations, and how organizations can be
designed to manage these problems. Finally, Section 3 will present cost
allocation as a way to either solve or cause the incentive problems introduced
in Section 2, and as an application of the tools presented in Section 1.

### Acknowledgements:

Like Bob Dylan, this course was born a long way away from where it's from, but
the starting point was reading Joel Demski's _Managerial Uses of Accounting
Information_, Zimmerman's _Accounting for Decision Making and Control_, and
reviewing Steve Huddart's excellent Accounting 440 taught at Penn State.
Similarities to those approaches are absolutely intentional, and any
shortcomings are my attempts at innovation.
