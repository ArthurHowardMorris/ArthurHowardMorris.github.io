### Lecture 1: Expectations and Conceptual Framework

This lecture reviews the [syllabus](/resources/semesters/s2024/ACCTG3210Syl.html), and presents a conceptual framework for the course.

### Lecture 2: The Nature of Costs  

In this lecture on cost analysis, we explore cost-volume-profit analysis and
its strategic role, emphasizing the understanding of total cost, including
fixed and unit costs. The session covers key concepts such as linear
relationships, emphasizing that these relationships only apply within finite
bounds (the relevant range). We continue by discussing various cost types,
including estimated fixed costs, step costs, and semi-variable costs, and show
how synergies complicate these models. The conclusion highlights the practical
application of incremental cost using Excel and Python, encouraging students to
navigate uncertainty in decision-making while underscoring the importance of
calculus in managerial accounting.

#### Python resources:

- For those who want to try Python, [I recommend Google's Colab as a way to start.](https://colab.research.google.com)
- For more depth, I recommend [_Python Programming for Economics and Finance_](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) especially ["Getting Started"](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/getting_started.html)
- Remember: Python is an option, __not a requirement__.

### Lecture 3: Cost Estimation 

In this lecture we discuss techniques for using data to estimate cost
functions. We emphasize the workflows used by Data Scientists, Statisticians
and Managerial Accountants. Includes demonstrations of regressions in Python
and Excel.

### Lecture 4: Non-linear programs

In this lecture we introduce a simple optimization problem facing a
multi-product firm. The example we use highlights both the benefits and
complexities of sharing capital between products. We also cover techniques for
visualizing these optimization problems using
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and solving these optimization problems
using [GEKKO](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This lecture emphasizes
Python-based tools for working through these problems, though the critical
steps of (1.) identifying choice variables, (2.) writing down an objective
function, (3.) and incorporating constraints, apply to any set of tools you may
use. We will review how to implement these techniques using Microsoft Excel in
subsequent lectures.
