## Course description:

Managers rely on accounting information to guide operations. This course builds
on Principles of Accounting II (ACCT 2200) to prepare students to produce and
use this information. Topics covered include decision-making techniques,
analysis of cost behavior, allocation of common and joint costs, use of cost
information in operational and strategic decisions, transfer pricing, and
performance measurement, and incentive compensation, with an emphasis on using
data science to bring accounting information into the decision process.

## Course Objectives:
By the end of this course, you should be able to:

1. Use real data to make business decisions.
2. Understand both the importance of management accounting for companies’
   strategic and operational decisions and the pitfalls of misusing management
   accounting information and techniques.  
2. Solve problems arising in business planning, with the aid of mathematical
   and statistical tools.  
3. Evaluate various techniques for control and performance evaluation in a
   decentralized environment, and provide recommendations for an effective
   control system.  
4. Understand how managerial and financial accounting relate to data analytics,
   data science, and business intelligence.  

The course will also provide you with opportunities to:

5. Think through a variety of business problems.  
6. Demonstrate team-work and leadership skills in solving operational and
   strategic planning problems.  
7. Demonstrate communication skills through class participation and case
   discussions.

| _Lectures and Cases:_ | Class discussions will involve both lectures and cases. Case discussions will occur on days when the cases are assigned in the course schedule below.| 
| _Preparation for Class:_|Students should prepare for class by completing the assigned reading and problems or case. All assignments and cases are due before class.|
| _Video Recordings:_ | No recordings of this class will be distributed. This is to facilitate class participation.|
| _Canvas:_ | Assignments will be turned in via Canvas, and I will use canvas to send updates. Please note that this website, and _not Canvas_ will host the slides and syllabus . Also note that the Canvas gradebook will only track assignments turned in via Canvas and not your final grade.|

## Grading

### Grading Scheme

|Description          |	Weight|
| ---                 | ---   |
| Class Participation |	16% |
| Cases & Problems    | 16% |
| Midterm             | 18% |
| Final Exam          | 50% |  
| Total	              | 100%|

### Class Participation:

Both lecture and case discussions will rely on random cold calling, you are
expected to attend the session for which you are registered. Student's names
will be randomly selected without replacement until all students have been
called on. Answers need not be correct to receive full credit, attendees who
answer will receive full credit, absentees will receive no credit for the
question. Exception for verified illness, students are required to notify TA &
instructor of illness via email in a timely manner.

### Cases & Problems

Cases and problems will be due at 2200 the night before the class in which they
are discussed. All assignments should be submitted in the formats specified in Canvas.

### Exams

Exams will be conducted in-person and will be closed book. Times and locations TBA.

 - __Midterm Exam:__ The midterm examination is scheduled from 7:00pm to
   8:00pm, Tuesday, 21 March 2022 in person. Locations: LTD, LTG, and 1103 (see
   Canvas for maps, and room assignments). The exam is closed book and
   communication with others is cheating and not allowed. All students are
   required to take the midterm exam at this pre-scheduled time, and there will
   be no make-up exam for it. Students absent from the midterm exam will
   receive zero mark for this component, except for highly unusual
   circumstances that cannot be controlled and avoided by the student---in
   which case the grade weight on the midterm exam will be loaded to the final
   examination component.

- __Final Exam:__ The comprehensive final examination is scheduled from 4:30 PM
  to 7:30 PM on 18 May 2023 in the S H Ho Sports Hall. The exam is closed book
  and communication with others is cheating and not allowed. All students are

### Acknowledgements:

Like Bob Dylan, this course was born a long way away from where it's from, but
the starting point was reading Joel Demski's _Managerial Uses of Accounting
Information_, Zimmerman's _Accounting for Decision Making and Control_, and
reviewing Steve Huddart's excellent Accounting 440 taught at Penn State.
Similarities to those approaches are absolutely intentional, and any
shortcomings are my attempts at innovation.
