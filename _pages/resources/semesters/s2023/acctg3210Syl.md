## Course description:

Managers rely on accounting information to guide operations. This course builds on Principles of Accounting II (ACCT 2200) to prepare students to produce and use this information. Topics covered include decision-making techniques, analysis of cost behavior, allocation of common and joint costs, use of cost information in operational and strategic decisions, transfer pricing, and performance measurement, and incentive compensation, with an emphasis on using data science to bring accounting information into the decision process.

## Course Objectives:
By the end of this course, you should be able to:

1. Use real data to make business decisions.
2. Understand both the importance of management accounting for companies’ strategic and operational decisions and the pitfalls of misusing management accounting information and techniques.  
2. Solve problems arising in business planning, with the aid of mathematical and statistical tools.  
3. Evaluate various techniques for control and performance evaluation in a decentralized environment, and provide recommendations for an effective control system.  
4. Understand how managerial and financial accounting relate to data analytics, data science, and business intelligence.  

The course will also provide you with opportunities to:

5. Think through a variety of business problems.  
6. Demonstrate team-work and leadership skills in solving operational and strategic planning problems.  
7. Demonstrate communication skills through class participation and case discussions.

### Acknowledgements:

Like Bob Dylan, this course was born a long way away from where it's from, but the starting point was reading Joel Demski's _Managerial Uses of Accounting Information_, Zimmerman's _Accounting for Decision Making and Control_, and reviewing Steve Huddart's excellent Accounting 440 taught at Penn State. Similarities to those approaches are absolutely intentional, and any shortcomings are my attempts at innovation.
