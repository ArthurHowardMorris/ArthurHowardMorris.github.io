I present more code in my slides that most accounting courses. This is
intentional, but I understand that it raises questions as well.

Here is an example of a question that often comes up (I'm quoting this from an
email because the question was presented so well):

> Dear Dr Morris, I wanted to reach out to clarify the role of coding in our
> accounting course. I’ve noticed that there is a lot of coding during
> lectures, and I’m curious about its importance in our studies. Is it
> essential for us to have coding skills for this course, or is it more of a
> supplementary tool? How would the exams be, would they be based on coding as
> well? Understanding this will help me focus my efforts appropriately.

This is a topic that comes up a lot in the course materials, so I am going to
link to those throughout my answer. If you've already looked at these materials
and still have this question, then I'm happy to offer more guidance. Please
don't hesitate to reach out.

## Data analysis tools are essential to the course

In this course, I use data analysis tools to answer the questions in the
homework as well as to create graphics for the slides. Let me start by setting
out the role of data analysis in the course and in management accounting.

1. [Using data to inform decisions is a course
   objective.](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/resources/semesters/s2025/acct3210syl.html#course-objectives)
2. [Data management and analysis is central to the definition of managerial
   accounting](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S1/Lecture1.pdf)
(see the end of page 2 where I quote the textbook).
3. The Accounting Profession finds itself threatened by technological change
   _because_ we, the students and teachers of accounting, have failed to adopt
appropriate data analysis tools as data needs and technology have progressed.
See page 3 of the pdf slides linked in 2.[^vid]

So, my answer to the first question is that data analysis tools are essential
to the course, and existentially important to careers in business or
accounting. This is my opinion, but it also aligns with the vision of the
Accounting Department Advisory Board. Our department chair, has articulated
this vision as follows:

> I would like to note that the increased emphasis of data analytics in our UG
> program reflects the feedback from our accounting advisory board members --
> the accounting education should go beyond training our students to take CPA
> exams and incorporate more data analytics and soft skill training.  As our
> board members are leaders of major current and potential employers of our
> graduates, the department has been working hard to design our course
> offering to meet the changing business needs. I believe that it will do
> students a disservice to offer advanced managerial accounting in an “old
> way” without Excel or Python.

[^vid]: If you haven't already read the syllabus, and watched or attended the
    first lecture, I have posted the video on out canvas page.  

## Okay, but are coding skills essential?

I take 'coding' in the question to refer specifically to the Python code that I
have in my slides. In this sense, Python is an __option__ rather than a supplement or a requirement (see e.g. [the discussion of Python in material for Lecture 2](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/resources/semesters/s2025/acct3210.html#python-resources).

The homework problems are designed to be solved with Excel or Python. Excel is
a useful tool for simple data tasks, and communication with data. But Excel
struggles to scale, and with more difficult analysis tasks (see e.g. the final
question from the [non-linear programming
assignment](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S4/lecture4nonlinearProgramming.slides.html#/11).
This is why I solve each problem in class using both tools. You will notice
that a few of the problems (often at the end of an assignment) are very hard to
solve in Excel, but are easy to solve in Python. This is intentional to help
illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.

## So, how will this be tested?

Questions of this nature are focused on setup and interpretation, rather than
on calculation and code. We've discussed this throughout the [non-linear
programming
lecture](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S4/lecture4nonlinearProgramming.slides.html#/0/1),
where I emphasize that I'm interested the setup steps rather than the
calculation itself. We will return to this topic in the [lecture 6 review
session](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/resources/semesters/s2025/acct3210.html#lecture-6-review).
