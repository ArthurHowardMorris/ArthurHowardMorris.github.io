### Lecture 2: The Nature of Costs  

In this lecture on cost analysis, we explore cost-volume-profit analysis and
its strategic role, emphasizing the understanding of total cost, including
fixed and unit costs. The session covers key concepts such as linear
relationships, emphasizing that these relationships only apply within finite
bounds (the relevant range). We continue by discussing various cost types,
including estimated fixed costs, step costs, and semi-variable costs, and show
how synergies complicate these models. The conclusion highlights the practical
application of incremental cost using Excel and Python, encouraging students to
navigate uncertainty in decision-making while underscoring the importance of
calculus in managerial accounting.

#### Python resources

- For those who want to try Python, [I recommend Google's Colab as a way to start.](https://colab.research.google.com)
- For more depth, I recommend [_Python Programming for Economics and Finance_](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) especially ["Getting Started"](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/getting_started.html)
- Remember: Python is an option, __not a requirement__.

### Lecture 3: Cost Estimation

In this lecture we discuss techniques for using data to estimate cost
functions. We emphasize the workflows used by Data Scientists, Statisticians
and Managerial Accountants. Includes demonstrations of regressions in Python
and Excel.

### Lecture 4: Non-linear programs

In this lecture we introduce a simple optimization problem facing a
multi-product firm. The example we use highlights both the benefits and
complexities of sharing capital between products. We also cover techniques for
visualizing these optimization problems using
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and solving these optimization problems
using [GEKKO](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This lecture emphasizes
Python-based tools for working through these problems, though the critical
steps of (1.) identifying choice variables, (2.) writing down an objective
function, (3.) and incorporating constraints, apply to any set of tools you may
use. We will review how to implement these techniques using Microsoft Excel in
subsequent lectures.

### Lecture 6: Review

_This is an entire lecture dedicated to all possible versions of the question:
"Dr. Morris" will you please tell me exactly what is going to be on the exam?"_

... the answer is probably something like: "Focus on setup and interpretation, but not the calculations."

At this point in the course, a lot of you will be interested in clarifying the role of 'coding' in the course. I've put together a small summary on this topic here:

- [__The Role of Coding in ACCT 3210__](/resources/semesters/s2025/note_on_code.html)

# Section 2: Theory

In this section of the course we shift our focus from the tools that we use to
address questions within the firm to the theories that shape our approach to
these questions.

### Lecture 7: Capital Budgeting

This lecture reviews the fundamentals of interest rates and the time value of money. We'll work through simple calculations using Python and Excel, and emphasize that, while textbook examples often ignore when things happen, timing matters!

- [Excel case example](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S7/case.xlsx)

### Lecture 8: Taxation of Returns

In this lecture we enrich the perspective of the previous lecture by incorporating taxes into the analysis. We use the variation in tax rates actoss U.S. states, and across assets to provide examples. Though the Hong Kong tax system is much more streamlined than the U.S. system, there are still many opportunities for tax planning. [The Hong Kong IRD has a list of resources about these,](https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/taxes/salaries/allowances/deductions/) though the details of either system are beyond the scope of this course. Our objective is to illustrate how differential tax rates shape demand, and returns, creating _implicit taxes_.

- [Excel example](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S8/AlternativeSavingsVehiclesCalc.xlsx)

### Lecture 9: Tax Shields and Taxation of Real and Financial Assets

In our final lecture on taxes we show that depreciation deductions create incentives for investment, and potential for arbitrage.

### Lecture 10: The Economics of Agency: Incentives, Effort, Risk, and Organizational Structure

In this lecture we discuss the problems that arise when owners hire others to make business decisions on their behalf. We begin with a simple example of an entrepreneur, and discuss how incentive problems arise and vary as the business grows.

- [The Economics of Agency: Incentives and Managerial Compensation](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S10/session10incentives.slides.html)

### Lecture 11: The Economics of Agency - How things go wrong

Today we discuss examples of how well intentioned compensation plans fail, when employees simply do what they are paid to do.

- [Slides](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S11/MoreIncentives.slides.html)

### Lecture 12: Mid-term review

_Back by popular demand: Another entire lecture devoted to the question: "Please tell me in detail exactly what will be on the exam, and leave nothing out. Also what are the answers?"_

# Section 3: Cost Allocation

<!--TODO: address the notion of the resource bargin here-->

<!-- In this section of the course we begin by discussing how the cost information is used to generate transfer prices, which exist to pass capital allocation  -->

### Lecture 13: The first lecture of the cost accounting portion of the course

We introduce the concept of transfer pricing, emphasizing it's connection to
the economics of agency. We also discuss basic terms and methods. In this
lecture we ignore taxes and focus on the role of transfer prices in reducing
agency costs.

<!-- - [Responsibility Accounting and Transfer Pricing](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S13/transferpricing.slides.html) -->

### Lecture 14

In this lecture we consider how taxes complicate our choice of transfer prices and limit our ability to use them to solve agency problems.

### Lecture 17: Course Feedback Session

__No lecture and no attendance today.__ Now that you have had a chance to
review the midterm, today's class will be devoted to giving me feedback about
how the course is going. The survey will be posted on the canvas site, and will
be used for the participation score (attendance) today. In addition to this
survey, please also take a few minutes to watch some of the videos for the
course and provide feedback on them. This will allow me to adapt the course to
better meet your needs for the final exam.
