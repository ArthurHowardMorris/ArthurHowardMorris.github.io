### Lecture 2: The Nature of Costs  

In this lecture on cost analysis, we explore cost-volume-profit analysis and
its strategic role, emphasizing the understanding of total cost, including
fixed and unit costs. The session covers key concepts such as linear
relationships, emphasizing that these relationships only apply within finite
bounds (the relevant range). We continue by discussing various cost types,
including estimated fixed costs, step costs, and semi-variable costs, and show
how synergies complicate these models. The conclusion highlights the practical
application of incremental cost using Excel and Python, encouraging students to
navigate uncertainty in decision-making while underscoring the importance of
calculus in managerial accounting.

- [Excel Example](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S2/Problem1.xlsx)

#### Python resources

- For those who want to try Python, [I recommend Google's Colab as a way to start.](https://colab.research.google.com)
- For more depth, I recommend [_Python Programming for Economics and Finance_](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) especially ["Getting Started"](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/getting_started.html)
- Remember: Python is an option, __not a requirement__.

### Lecture 3: Cost Estimation

In this lecture we discuss techniques for using data to estimate cost
functions. We emphasize the workflows used by Data Scientists, Statisticians
and Managerial Accountants. Includes demonstrations of regressions in Python
and Excel.

### Lecture 4: Non-linear programs

In this lecture we introduce a simple optimization problem facing a
multi-product firm. The example we use highlights both the benefits and
complexities of sharing capital between products. We also cover techniques for
visualizing these optimization problems using
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and solving these optimization problems
using [GEKKO](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This lecture emphasizes
Python-based tools for working through these problems, though the critical
steps of (1.) identifying choice variables, (2.) writing down an objective
function, (3.) and incorporating constraints, apply to any set of tools you may
use. We will review how to implement these techniques using Microsoft Excel in
subsequent lectures.

### Lecture 6: Review

_This is an entire lecture dedicated to all possible versions of the question: "Dr. Morris" will you please tell me exactly what is going to be on the exam?"_

# Section 2: Theory

### Lecture 7: Capital Budgeting

This lecture reviews the fundamentals of interest rates and the time value of money. We'll work through simple calculations using Python and Excel, and emphasize that, while textbook examples often ignore when things happen, timing matters!

### Lecture 8: Taxation of Returns

In this lecture we enrich the perspective of the previous lecture by incorporating taxes into the analysis.

### Lecture 9: Tax Shields and Taxation of Real and Financial Assets

In our final lecture on taxes we show that depreciation deductions create incentives for investment, and potential for arbitrage.

### Lecture 10: The Economics of Agency: Incentives, Effort, Risk, and Organizational Structure

In this lecture we discuss the problems that arise when owners hire others to make business decisions on their behalf. We begin with a simple example of an entrepreneur, and discuss how incentive problems arise and vary as the business grows.

# Section 3: Cost Allocation
<!-- In this section of the course we begin by discussing how the cost information is used to generate transfer prices, which exist to pass capital allocation  -->

### Lecture 13: The first lecture of the cost accounting portion of the course

We introduce the concept of transfer pricing, emphasizing it's connection to
the economics of agency. We also discuss basic terms and methods. In this
lecture we ignore taxes and focus on the role of transfer prices in reducing
agency costs.

- [Responsibility Accounting and Transfer Pricing](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/acct3210/S13/transferpricing.slides.html)

### Lecture 14

In this lecture we consider how taxes complicate our choice of transfer prices and limit our ability to use them to solve agency problems.
