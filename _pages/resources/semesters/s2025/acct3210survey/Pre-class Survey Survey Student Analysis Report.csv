Therefore\, I would like to take this major to prepare myself for the same career path. Secondly\, I understand that accounting is the most fundamental but important language in the business world. From a more macro view\, it facilitates economic and social development. So\, I would like to equip myself with such impactful and meaningful knowledge.

Yet if I do\, I will probably find an intern at the place where my graduate school locates (e.g.\, Canada),I wish I could try financial advisory or consulting or deals\, or fields that I have never touched upon next year.,I would like to work in Hong Kong. Although it's a small place\, it gathers the best FS firms with great industry reputations. Therefore\, there will be more opportunities available.,I think I would try jobs like consulting first as it requires the associate to fly around. It could be demanding physically and mentally so I would like to try it first before I get old.,That depends on my interest after I try different types of jobs\, but one certain thing is that I will stay in the financial services industry. ,I wish I can work in Switzerland as the environment there is really nice and cozy and I believe I would have a sufficient amount of technical knowledge and skills for the job that I would like to do in 10 years\, so moving to another country to work would be less challenging."
