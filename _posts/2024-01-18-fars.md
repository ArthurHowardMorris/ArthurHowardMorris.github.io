I'll be in Denver, CO on the 18th and 19th discussing two excellent papers.

- [Spillover Effect of Private Firm Disclosure on Public Firmsâ€™ Loan Pricing](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/fars_2024/spill.pdf)
- [Optimistic Gatekeepers: Credit Rating Optimism around M&A Deals by Bonsall, Koharki, Lock, and Neamtiu](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/fars_2024/optim_slides.pdf)

Two great coauthor teams, who have all done careful work on interesting research questions. I have high hopes for both projects.
