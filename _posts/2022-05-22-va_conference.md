I'll be giving a presentation based on my paper "Pay for Prudence" (with Salman Arif, John Donovan, and Yadav Gopalan) at the [2022 Virginia Tech Accounting Research Conference](https://acis.pamplin.vt.edu/Research/ResearchConf/Agenda2022.html). I'm unfortunately only participating virtually, but I'm very grateful to the organizers for making it possible for me to present even though HK-US travel isn't possible right now!
