## Listens, reads, and thinks -- 18 Feb 2021

### Listened to [Capitalisn't: Microsoft 1998 vs Google 2020: Antitrust and Big Tech](https://capitalisnt.com/episodes/microsoft-1998-vs-google-2020-antitrust-and-big-tech).

among other things:

- discussion of our framework for thinking big is bad
- current antitrust is only consumer welfare
	- _see [Bork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Antitrust_Paradox) which I read nearly 20 years ago_
- the founders thought that economic independence was the key to democracy
- no democracy in a company town

zhingales said something to the effect that he would prefer large monopolies to be run by the government because then there is at least some democratic recourse, while there is not for monopolies by private companies.

### Read [_The Road to Serfdom_ after 75 Years](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20191542)

updated my strong priors about hayek:

- hayek was responding to european socialist advocacy of totally planned society
- open to government intervention
- less worried about the 'welfare state slippery slope'
- open to nationalization, but, different than zhigales, thought that the government shouldn't have complete monopoly

### Thought:

- this is a far cry from the austrian economics (von mises, ayn rand) i was reading in my teens
- both takes on nationalization and monopoly were a surprise
- the tension between the two takes is quite interesting
- echos of [coase](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-24002-9_3)
