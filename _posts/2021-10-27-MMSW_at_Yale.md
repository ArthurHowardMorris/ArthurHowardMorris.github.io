I'll be giving a talk at the Yale Conference on Law and Macroeconomics about the effect of local corruption laws on inequality in mortgage markets, based on my work with [Albert Mensah](https://sites.google.com/site/albertmensahkwame/home), [Han Stice](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/stice-han/), and [Roger White](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/people/profile/1308641).

Slides are coming soon. The paper is here: [Individual Mortgage Lending and Corruption: Evidence from Local Corruption Crack-Downs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3888069)
