I'll be giving a talk at the [Yale Conference on Law and Macroeconomics](https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/yale-law-school-events/fourth-conference-law-and-macroeconomics?date=2021-10-27T00%3A00%3A00-04%3A00) about the effect of local corruption laws on inequality in mortgage markets, based on my work with [Albert Mensah](https://sites.google.com/site/albertmensahkwame/home), [Han Stice](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/stice-han/), and [Roger White](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/people/profile/1308641).

Slides are coming soon. The paper is here: [Individual Mortgage Lending, Public Corruption, Race and Gender: Evidence from Local Corruption Crack-Downs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3888069)
