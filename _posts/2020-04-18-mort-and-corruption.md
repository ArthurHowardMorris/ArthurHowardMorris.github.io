Individual mortgage lending and corruption: Evidence from local corruption crack-downs
with Albert Mensah, Han Stice, and Roger White.
- Under review at _Management Science_

Here is the abstract:  

> We examine how the imposition of local anti-corruption laws influences the behavior of mortgage lenders and borrowers. New home buyers face considerable government interaction (e.g., title transfers, property tax re-assessments, permitting), and prior research in the corporate arena documents that political corruption is particularly costly in domains where government interaction is frequent and necessary. Consistent with this reasoning, we find that following the passage of anti-corruption laws, banks both accept a greater percentage of mortgage applications and offer more favorable credit terms to borrowers (with no accompanying change in delinquency rates). Broadly, our results suggest that (1) public corruption introduces meaningful incremental costs and uncertainty into individualsâ€™ dealings related to residential real estate, and (2) newly introduced local anti-corruption laws reduce these costs and uncertainty to the extent that lenders are more generous to affected residential mortgage borrowers.  

I love cracking into a new data source, especially if it's free and open to the public. This is my first paper with the [HMDA data from the CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/), but I'm looking forward to more.
