Recent books with brief notes. In general I don't confess to reading books that I wouldn't recommend, and these are my confessions:

## _What makes a terrorist_

## _Rockonomics_

## _Welcome to the Terrordome_

## _The Box_

A history of the shipping container. Required reading for anyone who lives near a deepwater port.

## _The Anarchy_

A military history of the East India Company.

## _The Murder of Lehman Brothers: An insider's look at the Global Meltdown_

An insider's perspective on how Lehman became so exposed to the real estate market that even a small shift in home prices would bring the company down.
Not a ton of information that isn't available elsewhere. A particularly interesting detail that I hadn't noticed before reading this book is that when approached with concerns about real estate exposure, Fuld/Gregory reorganized the risk management team rather than address their concerns.

A more apt title might be: _The Series of Lifestyle Choices that Ended, Predictably, in Lehman Brothers' Death_

## _Too big to fail_

This book is something of an oral history of the peak of the financial crisis. An interesting view on how the decisions about whom to bail out and whom to let fail played out. The portions concerning Lehman corroborate a lot of what is in _The Murder of Lehman Brothers_.

## _The big short_

By Michael Lewis. Most folks my age will remember most of this story from living through it. In the popular consciousness, MBSs are inscrutable, but it really seems that everyone who scrutinized them immediately saw the problem with them.  All it took was for someone to actually look at what was in one of the MBSs.

## _Big debt crises_

By Ray Dalio and a laptop. A simple, and exhaustive, analysis of 51 debt crises. Great reference, part of it was apparently written by a computer but all of it could have been.  

## _Guaranteed to Fail_

<!-- An excellent treatment of the -->

## [_It doesn't have to be crazy at work._](https://basecamp.com/books/calm "Book Link").

Written by the founders of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com "Basecamp company site"), the book is part manifesto part self-help guide for folks -- the happy few -- who directly control organizational culture.

That's not most of us, not even in academia.

But, for the rest of us, there is the very trenchant argument that quality of time spent working is more important than quantity of time spent working. Jason and David argue that you don't need to be the hardest working, or the smartest, you just need to give yourself the time and space  you need to do your best work. If there's anything for everyone in this book, it's a renewed focus on the quality of the time we spend 'working,' in addition to the quantity.

The writing is focused and vivid enough that the read was not unpleasant on the iPhone during a few Shanghai Metro commutes.

## _The Black Swan_

By Nassim Taleb. The fundamental idea here is a good one: Some distributions are not normal, and it's important to know when you are dealing with one. The book gets roped into the financial crisis conversation. That implies that the financial crisis was caused by a bunch of people betting that home prices wouldn't _crash_, but the financial crisis seems to have been caused by a bunch of people betting that home prices wouldn't _ever stop going up_.

## _The Sense of Style_

## _When Genius Failed_

The story of Long Term Capital Management. The writing is reasonably technical, it's clear that the author has a basic understanding of finance and financial economics.
