For some insightful commute reading, I recommend [___It doesn't have to be crazy at work.___](https://basecamp.com/books/calm "Book Link"). 

Written by the founders of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com "Basecamp company site"), the book is part manifesto part self-help guide for folks -- the happy few -- who directly control organizational culture. 

That's not most of us, not even in academia.

But, for the rest of us, there is the very trenchant argument that quality of time spent working is more important than quantity of time spent working. Jason and David argue that you don't need to be the hardest working, or the smartest, you just need to give yourself the time and space  you need to do your best work. If there's anything for everyone in this book, it's a renewed focus on the quality of the time we spend 'working,' in addition to the quantity. 

The writing is focused and vivid enough that the read was not unpleasant on the iPhone during a few Shanghai Metro commutes.
