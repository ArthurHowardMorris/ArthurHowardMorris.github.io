[Taxation of debt renegotiations and contract design:  Insights for incomplete contract theory](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2981069)
with Scott Dyreng, and Elia Ferracuti.

Here is the abstract:

> We exploit the joint effect of a change to the tax consequences of renegotiating U.S. syndicated loans and borrower-lender marginal tax rate differentials to isolate the causal link between renegotiation costs and debt contract design. TD9599 altered the tax consequencesof renegotiating U.S. syndicated loans, while leaving the tax consequences of renegotiatingU.S. single-lender and non-U.S. syndicated loans unchanged. In this setting, we examine how debt maturity, initial likelihood of covenant violation, and the use of performance pricing provisions change following the adoption of TD9599.  Consistent with the theory of incomplete contracts, we find that as renegotiation costs fall, the maturity of debt contracts lengthens, the likelihood of covenant violation increases, and the use of performance pricing provisions becomes less frequent. The evidence indicates that contracting parties use ex-ante allocation of cash flow rights through contract design and ex-post reallocation of decision rights through renegotiation as local substitutes, where the preference for one mechanism versus the other depends on renegotiation costs.
