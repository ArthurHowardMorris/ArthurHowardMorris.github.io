The first lesson is: Do not obey in advance.

Any fall is a great time to read or reread Timothy Snyder's essential _On
Tyranny_. This fall, if you're an American, it's urgent. Whatever the
outcome of the election, the lessons of the 20th Century are essential _now_.

The first lesson of the 20th Century, of the spread of tyranny across Europe in
the guise of Nazism and Communism, is: Don't obey in advance.

Wait until you must to comply.

The Washington Post and LA Times are showing us how this works right now. Did
Donald Trump and JD Vance _know_ that Jeff Bezos[^and] was afraid of them? That he
was ready to capitulate to their demands on the content of his paper if they
asked? No. Not until he did without being asked. Jeff Bezos,[^and] by pulling the
Washington Post's endorsement of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, is teaching the
second Trump administration about it's power over the media and over the
billionaire class.[^many]

I happen to have the book in three formats: The pocket-sized version (you can
put it next to your pocket Constitution), the comic/graphic novel version
(which I sent to everyone in my family in 2022 in preparation for just this
eventuality), and the audio book. I recommend them all, though the extended
audio book includes an additional section on the War in Ukraine is worth the
slight increase in time and treasure.

Timothy Snyder's site has links to purchase all of the formats. [Buy _On
Tyranny_ anywhere, (even Amazon!) but buy it
somewhere.](https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny)
