title: "Five Pillars: Because I haven't found all seven."
---

To me, empiricists are artisans. I see five interconnected pillars, the strength of which determine an empiricist's capability. While some specialization among co-authors is natural, and even advantageous, my view is that a balanced approach to strengthening these pillars will increase any researcher's capability. 

These are in no particular order.

# Mathematics:

Math is tables stakes in this business, but we all have vastly differing backgrounds. I used the following four books as pre-Ph.D. program review to varying degrees (the Strang text makes Wooldrige quite approachable).

- Introduction to Linear Algebra, Strang
- Calculus, Apostol
- Mathematics for Economists, Simon and Blume
- Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation, Train
