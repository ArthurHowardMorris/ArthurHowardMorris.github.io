As an American living abroad it's been tough to understand what is happening in the US. As one fortunate to be living in Hong Kong, where COVID-19 has been relatively well managed (8 million people, 1,194 cases, 7 deaths) through contact tracing and social distancing (no stay at home orders), I've been hungry -- as we all have I'm sure -- for good information about the virus, its spread, and its effects. 

While this has been a tough time for most folks, economists, epidemiologist, and data scientists have been stunningly productive. I'm going to spend a few posts trying to put together some semblance of a summary/catalog of what I've found interesting, impressive, and informative.

I'll start with podcasts.

There are two that are totally dedicated to the pandemic, which have really impressed me, and then a number of other episodes that I recommend. 

## [Coronavirus: Fact vs Fiction](https://edition.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/corona-virus)

The first is from Dr. Sanjay Gupta ([if you don't know him check him out on the Axe Files](https://omny.fm/shows/the-axe-files-with-david-axelrod/ep-378-dr-sanjay-gupta)... also on CNN I guess, if you're the sort of person that watches TV). 

>"Join CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the latest news about the coronavirus. He'll make sense of the headlines, speak with the experts and give you all the information you need to stay safe and healthy."_

## [Pandemic Economics](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/podcast/pandemic-economics/)

The second podcast comes from the University of Chicago's Becker-Freedman institute. The hosts are journalists who interview economists.

>"Insights from top economists to help you navigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Hosts Tess Vigeland and Eduardo Porter talk to University of Chicago economists about their research, revealing important new ways to make sense of this moment. Economics is at the heart of crucial decisions about how we confront the COVID-19 crisis. Topics range from global trade to the changing meaning of work. Pandemic Economics is produced by the Becker Friedman Institute and Stitcher and is part of the University of Chicago podcast network. Production and original music in this series is by Story Mechanics."_

## [America Dissected: Season II - Coronavirus](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/america-dissected/)

Next is a series of episodes from Abdul El-Sayed's excellent public health podcast. Pre-pandemic this podcast had a somewhat more broad focus, but now that we are in the middle of a public health crisis this series has become an important structural view of the American public health system and how we got where we are.

>"The Coronavirus is now a global pandemic. How did we get here? What went wrong? What do we do about it now? In season 2, Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a physician and former city health commissioner, will keep you updated on what you need to know about COVID-19, what led us to this crisis in the first place, and what policies can lead us out. New episodes of America Dissected: Coronavirus every Tuesday & Friday."

## [Capitalisn't](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/capitalisnt/id1326698855)

The problem with getting top researchers together to talk about their work, and the work of their peers, is that this group of well trained minds just end up bending their not-inconsiderable intellects toward the exquisite qualities of the Kool-Aid that they are drinking. These conversations between Luigi Zingales and Kate Waldock are never that. For Coronavirus Education, check out the episodes since about March, but they are all worth a listen.

>"Capitalism is the engine of prosperity. Capitalism sows the seeds of its own demise. Could both be right? Economists Luigi Zingales (University of Chicago) and Kate Waldock (Georgetown) share the sort of irreverent banter youâ€™d hear between economists at a bar, if economists were capable of sarcasm and social enough to go out to bars. Our show is part of the University of Chicago Podcast Network."
