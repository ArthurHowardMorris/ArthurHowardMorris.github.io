On 2202.09.03 I'll be presenting a talk based on my paper [Individual Mortgage Lending, Public Corruption, Race and Gender: Evidence from Local Corruption Crack-Downs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3888069)  
(with [Albert Mensah](https://sites.google.com/site/albertmensahkwame/home), [Han Stice](https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/stice-han/), and [Roger White](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/people/profile/1308641)) at the 2022 Hong Kong Junior Accounting Faculty Conference.

[My slides are posted here](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/HKJF_slides/MMSW_hkjfc.slides.html) (will launch in your browser).
