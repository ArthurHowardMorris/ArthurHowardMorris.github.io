Tomorrow I'll be presenting a talk based on my current working paper
["Pollution, Specialization, and Uncertainty: The Use and Design of
Environmental Covenants in Debt
Contracts"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5007113) (with
Ting Dai and Daniele Macciocchi) at Hong Kong Poly U's "Pathways to a Green
Business Transition" RCGB Conference.

[Here are the slides.](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/polyu_conf_2025/poly.pdf)
