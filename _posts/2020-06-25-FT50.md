# Accounting, Finance, and Econ journals in the [The FT 50:](https://www.ft.com/content/3405a512-5cbb-11e1-8f1f-00144feabdc0#axzz4J5U4V1EX)

These are the 50 journals that the Financial Times uses in their research rankings for business schools. I've put the journals that are relevant to my work into _unordered_
lists by each of the subject areas that I work in. I've also listed impact factors below. 

Perhaps most useful, I'm including links to the code and data policies. I anticipate that this information will change rapidly, so please let me know if you find my information out of date.

## Accounting
- [__Journal of Accounting and Economics__](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-accounting-and-economics)
	- [EF 0.012, AI 4.2, EFn 1.3](http://eigenfactor.org/projects/journalRank/rankings.php?bsearch=JOURNAL+OF+ACCOUNTING+%26+ECONOMICS&searchby=journal&orderby=eigenfactor)

	- Data and code:

		> This journal encourages and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.
	
		> To foster transparency, we encourage you to state the availability of your data in your submission. This may be a requirement of your funding body or institution. If your data is unavailable to access or unsuitable to post, you will have the opportunity to indicate why during the submission process, for example by stating that the research data is confidential. The statement will appear with your published article on ScienceDirect. For more information, visit the Data Statement page.

		> Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide information about the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication, as well as information about access to data and programs.  Data and programs should be archived in the [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea).
		
		> As part of the archive, authors must provide a README file listing all included files and documenting the purpose, format, and provenance of each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted.  The data and code README file (in PDF format) must also be uploaded to Manuscript Central.
		
		> See the [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) for more information.

		> Econometrica has the policy that all empirical, experimental and simulation results must be replicable.

(Authors of experimental papers can consult the more detailed posted information regarding submission of [Experimental papers](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/information-authors/instructions-submitting-articles#experimental).

	- [Data Policy](https://academic.oup.com/qje/pages/Data_Policy)
		
		> In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics has adopted the American Economic Review data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy.

		> It is the policy of the Quarterly Journal of Economics to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the QJE , prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on a data repository linked to the QJE website. Submissions should include a cover letter in which the Editors are notified if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

		> After acceptance, authors are expected to post their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, to the QJE Dataverse repository. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter.

	- [Data Policy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jpe/datapolicy)
		
		> In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Political Economy has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy.

		> It is the policy of the Journal of Political Economy to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers, in particular those that contain empirical work, simulations, experimental work, or numerical computations, must provide to the Journal, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the JPE Web site. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

		> After acceptance, authors are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the JPE office. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter.

	- [Data Availability Policy](https://restud.github.io/data-editor/before/#data-availability-policy)

		> Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work must in principle make available to the journal any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication. The submission of this material indicates that authors license users to download, copy, and modify it. Such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Review of Economic Studies as the original publisher. These will be posted in the Review’s Replication Archive. The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the above requirements cannot be met for any reason (see details below). We reserve the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.

		> As soon as possible after receiving instructions from the Journal Manager, authors of accepted papers are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the Review office. Questions regarding any aspect of this policy should be forwarded to the Data Editor.
