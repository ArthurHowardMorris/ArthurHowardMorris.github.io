At AAA this week I'll be discussing three interesting papers:
1. [Shielding from the Pandemic: COVID-19 Exclusion Provision in Debt Contracts](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/AAA_2023_covid/slides_beam.pdf)
2. [The Effects of Compensation and Non-Compensation-Based Controls for Chief Physicians on the Quality of Care: An Empirical Study](https://arthurhowardmorris.github.io/assets/slides/AAA_2023_docs/slides_beam.pdf).
3. [Does Algorithmic Trading Affect Forced CEO Turnover? A Learning Hypothesis]()
