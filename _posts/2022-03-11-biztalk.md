I'll be giving a talk based on my recently published paper ["Financial Shocks to Lenders and the Composition of Financial Covenants"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2021.101426) (with [Hans Christensen](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/c/hans-b-christensen),  [Daniele Macciocchi](https://www.bus.miami.edu/thought-leadership/faculty/accounting/macciocchi.html), and [Valeri Nikolaev](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/n/valeri-nikolaev))
 as part of HKUST's BizTalks series. The title of the talk is "An Unexpected Way that Defaults Impact Other Borrowers".
