## Courses:

## Briefly Noted:

- Since we have a 'winter' semester that is just the month of January, it feels most natural to think of my 'year' as ending at the end---rather than the beginning---of January.
- The revision that we completed for the Accounting Review was the most extensive review that I've ever completed. It took a substantial amount of time. This was my first time working with two referees (RAST and JAE are my only other experiences), and it's quite a bit more effort to address two sets of feedback. In this case, the comments were all very good, we learned a lot, and the new paper is much improved.

## Looking forward:

In 2024 I have a number of projects that I hope to have drafts of by the end of 2024. I'm listing them here by their mnemonics for my reference: 

- LMZ
- MSX 
- DMME 
- HM 
- M 

These are all at various stages, but I would like to have them in the review process by the end of the year. As well as two/three exciting new projects that I'd like to see develop.
I also have several tools that I've developed for my own use, which might be of use to others so if I have the time I'd like to publish them.
