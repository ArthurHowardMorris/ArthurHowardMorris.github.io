title: "Changing minds, exposure and persuasion."

The science of how people change their minds is far outside of my area of expertise.

My main exposure to the science of persuasion is through a scandal that happened while I was in grad school. Basically, a student at UCLA came up with a clever study to test the ability of canvassers to change minds, [but fabricated the study instead of running it](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-a-major-retraction-shows-were-all-vulnerable-to-faked-data/). Which is a shame, because follow up studies **actually worked**. Of course, being in grad school at the time the saga of a student crashing his very promising career into the sun was just the sort of thing that was hard for a lot of us to look away from. The side effect was that I read more of the literature on persuasion than I had originally intended. Being very much a strong-opinions-loosely held sort of person, I was surprised to learn that in 2015 the literature suggested that attitudes on social and other issues are rather fixed.
