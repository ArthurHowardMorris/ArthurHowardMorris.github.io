Political Information Flow and Management Guidance in the Hong Kong Economic Times.

Today's issue of the Hong Kong Economic Times features a short article I wrote
with the excellent editing and translation help of LUK Kam Wing [(link)](https://paper.hket.com/article/3850913).

The article, published in Cantonese, summarizes the findings of "[Political
Information Flow and Management
Guidance](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11142-022-09671-7)" which my co-authors,
[Dane Christensen](https://business.uoregon.edu/faculty/dane-christensen),
[Beverly
Walther](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/walther_beverly.aspx),
and [Laura
Wellman](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/walther_beverly.aspx),
and I published in the _Review of Accounting Studies_ in 2022.
