The stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). 

A referee raised the SUTVA in a revision that I'm working on. It's an important
topic, that gets less discussion than it deserves. Since the topic is often
folded into the random assignment assumption,[^harms] I know less about the history of
the idea than I should. This post is going to be a quick collection of notes
while I chase the idea through the history of econometrics.

[^harms]: For example Mostly Harmless Econometrics uses the benchmark
    assumption of random assignment, and thus does not discuss the SUTVA.

I always start with Woolridge (2010) because it's where I learned everything the first time.

### Woolridge (2010):

To pull on the SUTVA thread, let's look at the discussion in AIR, and see where
that takes us.

### Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996):

The AIR paper and it's placement of Instrumental Variables within the context
of the Rubin Causal Model is worth it's own post. In fact it's worth a whole
book, and there are at least three very good ones (Mostly Harmless
Econometrics, Causal Inference: A Mixtape, and Mastering 'Metrics: The Path
from Cause to Effect). But I'm interested in the SUTVA assumption, so I'm after
Rubin (1978,1980,1990).

### Rubin (1990):

> ...agricultural experimenters had used guard rows between neighboring plots
> treated differently to avoid "interference between units." ... I call (Rubin,
> 1980) the assumption \[of no interference between units\] the
> "stable-unit-treatment-value assumption", SUTVA, or simply "the stability
> assumption."

This quote is a little chopped up to avoid some notation that is explained in a
more compact manner in Rubin (1980). I'm also avoiding the discussion of how to
relax this assumption, as that deserves---and will soon get---it's own post. For
now I'm just chasing the SUTVA back to it's origin.  

### Rubin (1980): 

> In the paired comparison experiment, let $Y_{it}$ be the response of the
> $i$th unit ($i=1,\dots,2n$) if exposed to treatment $j$ $(j=1,2)$, where
> $Y={Y_{it}}$ is the $2n \times 2$ matrix of values of $Y_ij$. The assumption

> between units (Cox 1958, p. 19) leading to different outcomes depending on
> the treatments other units received... 

This notation is what I elided from Rubin (1990) where it was spread over a
much longer passage. I believe that this passage is where Rubin coined the
SUTVA, though, as we'll see, the idea is in Rubin (1978) and comes from Cox
(1958).

An even more compact version of this assumption is in Rosenbaum & Rubin (1983):

> The assumption that there is a unique value $r_{it}$ corresponding to unit
> $i$ and treatment $t$ has been called the stable unit-treatment value
> assumption (Rubin, 1980)

### Rubin (1978)

> ...for each $k$, $Y_{kt}^{t}$ represents the $i$th experimental unit's
> observable value of $Y_k$ for all values of $W$ such that $W_i = t (> 0)$.
> Without this assumption, called "no 'interference' between different units"
> by Cox (1958, page 19), is usually made in practice. A common exception is
> cross-over designs with additional carry-over effects assumed. Our model can
> be extended to include more general assumptions about interference effects
> between units, but for notational and descriptive simplicity we assume $T$
> versions of each $Y_k$ are adequate. The general results of this paper do not
> rely on the no-interference assumption. 

Before we move on to Cox (1958, page 19), note that the extension mentioned
here is in Rubin (1990), where the notation is augmented to allow for
carry-over.

### Cox (1958, page 19)

> The last aspect of the assumption (1) to need discussion is the requirement
> that the observation on one unit should be unaffected by the particular
> assignment of treatments to the other units, i.e. that there is no
> "interference" between units. In many experiments the different units are
> physically distinct and the assumption is automatically satisfied. If,
> however, the same object is used as a unit several times, or if different
> unit are in physical contact, difficulties can arise...

The discussion continues with examples of how the assumption can be violated,
and how estimates of the true treatment values can be recovered.

## Summary:

Key points:

1. The SUTVA seems to start with Cox (1958), but is formalized by Rubin
   (1978,1980,1990). 
2. The analogy of adjoining plots contaminating each other is very useful, both
   in terms of stating the problem concretely, and in thinking about how to
   implement solutions.
3. The SUTVA is subsumed by the assumption of random assignment (Woolridge
   2010), which explains why it is often not mentioned in Econometrics
   textbooks. It is interesting to note that the work Rubin was doing as he
   formalized this was directly related to the role of randomization. In
   particular Rubin (1978) is exploring the utility of randomization in
   Bayesian analysis, thus he could not assume random assignment.
4. Relaxation of the SUTVA assumption is included in Cox (1958), Rubin (1990),
   and Angrist et al. (1996).
5. The discussion in the statistics literature focuses on the "no interference" formulation.

## "No general equilibrium effects" formulation of the SUTVA

### Cameron & Trivedi (2005)

In my collection of econometrics textbooks the only one, other than Wooldridge (2010) that discusses the SUTVA is Cameron and Trivedi:

> Matching is a persuasive and attractive methodology if (1) we can control for
> a rich set of __x__ variables, (2) there are many potential controls, and (3)
> the \[__average treatment effect on the treated__ (__ATET__)\] is the
> parameter of interest. It also requires the "no general equilibrium effects"
> assumption or __stable unit treatment values assumption (SUTVA)__, which
> implies that treatment does not indirectly affect untreated observations. (p. 872)

Several things are interesting about this discussion. First, while Wooldridge (2010),
Angrist et al. (1996), and Rubin (1990,1980,1978) and Cox (1958) discusses the
SUTVA as an assumption required, or used, to characterize treatment effects in
the potential outcomes framework (i.e. the Rubin causal model), Cameron and
Trivedi (2005) take a different approach. Cameron and Trivedi introduce
treatment evaluation in a random assignment setting, and then introduce
matching as a solution to the problems that arise when matching is not
possible, then introduce the SUTVA in the discussion of matching. Though
slightly different presentations, these are not contradictory approaches.

Second, this echos the "no general equilibrium effects" formulation of the
SUTVA, mentioned by Wooldridge which is what I want to explore next. Since, I'm
interested in how this assumption is addressed in applied econometrics, lets
turn to Heckman, Lockner, and Taber (1998)
