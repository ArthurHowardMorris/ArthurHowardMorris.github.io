I teach Managerial Accounting at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I research the relationships that form within and across the boundaries of the firm, how stakeholders use contracts to formalize these relationships, and how those contracts shape behavior.

Before taking my current position in Hong Kong, I taught at NYU - Shanghai where I was an Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow.

> We examine whether politically active firms play a role in disseminating political information via their management guidance. We use multiple proxies based on campaign financing activity or the presence of a government affairs office to capture whether a firm is politically active. We find that politically active firms are more likely to issue management guidance overall, and especially when the government is a key customer of the firm. Further, relative to politically inactive firms, the guidance released by politically active firms is more likely to discuss government policies. In addition to using numerous econometric techniques to address self-selection concerns, we examine the timing of when guidance is issued. We find that politically active firms are more likely to issue guidance prior to the public revelation of government policy decisions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the privileged information firms obtain through their political activities is shared with investors through voluntary disclosures.
